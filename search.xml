    <title>The View from a WWF Poster: Who Should be Responsible and What’s the Solution to Environmental Problems?</title>
    <url>/2021/12/25/The-View-from-a-WWF-Poster-Who-Should-be-Responsible-and-What%E2%80%99s-the-Solution-to-Environmental-Problems/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p> Nowadays, environmental problems are gaining increasing attention globally. Forests are disappearing, animals are being killed and oceans are being polluted. This is also what is portrayed in a WWF poster. A huge offshore drilling platform is drawn in the center, killing a lot of fish under it. At the bottom, there’s an anchorage saying “our hunger for fossil fuels is destroying the oceans”. The poster shows the cruelty of ocean pollution caused by exploiting fossil fuels through visual art. In fact, the underlying opinion of the poster is all people who benefit from modern fossil technologies should be responsible for pollution, and it tries to motivate people to take action by raising viewers’ negative emotions. (Below is the poster made by WWF.)</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/12/167da8bd96972d0b.jpg" alt="The poster made by WWF"></p>
<p>When it comes to who should be responsible for pollution, the problem is long been argued. Among all opinions, two provided by Crutzen and Malm can be very representative. They both agreed that our nature is disturbed by humans, and we humans should take responsibility. However, Crutzen reckons that all human beings are responsible and we should develop science and technology to address the environmental and energy issues. (Crutzen,2) In <em>Geology of Mankind</em>, he listed a set of examples to show the climate and atmosphere is has been changed greatly by humans since the industrial revolution. (Crutzen,1) The whole nature comes into an era of Anthropocene, where the power of humans is not neglectable. (Crutzen,2) So technological methods are needed when trying to solve the problem as it’s caused by technology development. (Crutzen,1)</p>
<p>On the other hand, Malm denies the claim all human being responsible. Instead of Anthropocene, Malm coined “Capitalocene” in <em>The view from Dominica: Anthropocene or Capitalocene</em> to show that it is capitalists, instead of all human beings, should be responsible. (Malm,3) He claims that capitalists are those who gain profit from fossil fuels in nature, so environmental problems are their fault. (Malm,4) However, those who are irrelevant to nature-disturbing behaviors are getting into trouble. For example, people in Dominica, a country where “most people subsisted on small-scale farming”, can be trapped in hurricanes caused by the warming climate. (Malm,2) But they are innocent as they produce no greenhouse gases and no pollution. (Malm,2) It is the capitalists that should be punished. (Malm,4) So Malm proposed that governments and international institutes should limit capitalists’ exploiting behavior through laws and other political ways. (Malm,4)</p>
<p>The poster holds an opinion that is between the two, blaming all people who benefit from fossil fuels. When it comes to who should be responsible, the poster stands closer to Crutzen, as most people benefit from nature-disturbing technologies. And the opinion proposed in the poster doesn’t conflict with Malm’s argument with Crutzen, as people who live in a way “without modern” like Dominicans are excluded. But when it comes to solutions, the poster may rely more on appealing to people instead of technology methods proposed by Crutzen. All these opinions are hidden behind the art expression of the poster.</p>
<p>Various methods in visual art are used in the poster to raise people’s negative emotions and to motivate them to take measures. Only four keys appeared (black, white, dull-red, and blue), making them more impressive, thus making readers feel shocked by what is portrayed. Only black and white is used in the center to draw the drilling platform and dead fishes. The background is dull-red, which is the color of coagulated blood. Covering the whole background, the key shocks viewers by implying a large number of killed fish through visual art. In particular, fishes are all black, which can have two implications: first, the fish is no longer living. Second, the fish died of petrol, (which is also black), that leaked and polluted the ocean. The whole scene gives viewers a strong sense of lifelessness. As humans, more general, as living things, all the people prefer a world with lives instead of only inorganic matter. Also, death, no matter human’s or other living things, can lead to sympathy. That’s because the deep-lying value of all the living things is created equal. In this sense, viewers who haven’t noticed the link between petrol use and themselves can be sympathetic, and those who discovered they are to be blamed can be regretful to their energy-wasting behaviors.</p>
<p>Besides, the sharp contrast of the shape of the fishes and the platform can further develop viewers’ emotions. The sympathetic response for the fish could lead to anger towards petrol companies, whereas the regret response could lead to guilty feelings and repent of so much petrol. The platform is drawn more in rectangles, and fishes are drawn more in curves. Though it’s only a simple fact that the surfaces of living things are smoother compared to machines, this is meaningful in the poster. The curve of the fish reminds viewers of the fishes once lived. They have smooth body shapes but were now completely black and dead. Viewers shocked by the lifelessness can be either angry, wanting to find out the criminal, or guilty, feeling regret and sorry for the ocean creatures for their fossil use.</p>
<p>The two different reactions created by the key and shape can finally be united and converted into guilt and shame by the anchorage at the bottom. The anchorage below the painting “our hunger for fossil fuels is destroying the ocean” clearly shows the attitude of the author: we, humans benefit from using fossil fuels, should be responsible for the death of the fishes and we should use fewer fuels to avoid destroying the ocean. Those who previously consider petrol companies being responsible are forced to realize they are the customer, the final master of all the cruel machines. All viewers are forced to reflect on their daily petrol use. The use of “our” robbed viewers of all excuses, directly converting all the shock, sympathy, regret, and anger accumulated by the keys outline into guilty. The strong emotion can push people to change their behaviors thus reaching the purpose of entreating them to save energy.</p>
<p>All the use of keys, shapes, and anchorage serves the hiding opinion, that all modern people are responsible. In this paper, “modern people” refers to people enjoying the benefit of industrialization and modernization, especially the benefit of using fossil fuels and plastic products. The fact that the poster hopes viewers to feel guilty must be set on the viewers having used fossil fuels. After all, how can you expect a man who never uses petrol to save petrol? This can also be seen as the poster is an online poster, which means mainly modern people can have access to it. All these imply that, when it comes to who should be responsible, the poster stands closer to Crutzen, but it excludes people living outside the modern world. Nevertheless, the poster doesn’t pursue a technical solution, but rather a managing one like Malm. Instead of relying on science’s development, the poster tries to solve environmental problems through appealing and regulating. The difference between the poster and Malm is that Malm asks the government to manage a small number of capitalists forcefully, but the poster entreats all people to save the environment.</p>
<p>To be more essential, the form of the poster and the poster’s creator, WWF, decides its opinion, which puts all modern people guilty. The purpose of a poster is to appeal to more people, so it cannot only aim at a small number of people, like capitalists. What it is expected to do is be shown to a large number of modern people, then generating huge effect by letting every people does a little. Besides the art form, the organization behind it is also related. As a non-governmental organization, what WWF can do is limited. It doesn’t have the ability to develop technology like what Crutzen says, neither can it limit the actions of capitalists like Malm says. But it actually can change others’ behavior through appealing in a rather emotional way. By putting every modern people be responsible, these people can be motivated and help save the environment. That’s why the poster won’t accuse capitalists in a Malm way, but use the managing method differently. In other words, finding out who is to blame is not the core mission of the poster and WWF. Choosing to support this opinion is only because, for this specific poster, this is the best opinion that can inspire people to take action to save our nature.</p>
<p>However, the stereotype in the poster can decrease the poster’s credit and effect. Objectively speaking, petrol isn’t always a pollution-causer, sometimes, it can reduce pollution in some circumstances. According to <em>The Two Worlds in the Anthropocene: A New Approach for Managing and Coping with Climate Change,</em> a speech given by Veerabhadran Ramanathan, the most serious problem is not caused by petrol but firewood. He found that “160 million homes along India’s Indo-Gangetic plains alone burn firewood from the forests just to meet basic needs”. (Veerabhadran,2) That’s really a way of low-efficiency and can cause more pollution. (Veerabhadran,2) According to his estimation, that cleaner alternative like petrol be provided to these people “can slow down warming by 50% by 2050”. (Veerabhadran,8) What Veerabhadran proposed can be a strong opposer to Malm and the poster’s view. It shows in some cases, capitalism and modernism can help save the environment. On this point, using less sea petrol is not more emergency than making it possible for a huge number of people gaining the access to cleaner fossil fuels. (Veerabhadran,10) This point can make the claim of the poster being partial, as maybe the use of fuel may save some animals by avoiding wood from being cut and burned. Although this can decrease the credit of the poster, what the poster proposed is not all wrong. After all, saving energy is no-fault. (Below is the effect of reducing burning firewood suggested by Veerabhadran)</p>
<img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/12/e4e92c13d0bb2780.png" alt="The effect of reducing burning firewood suggested by Veerabhadran" style="zoom: 67%;" />





<p>Maybe some people may consider that, instead of all modern people, the poster aims only at those whose work is related to petrol. This may make sense because they think the majority don’t think they are related to the remote offshore drilling platform. However, although many haven’t seen the platform, they do know the machine is used to produce fossil fuels, and this can remind them of their daily fuel use. Besides, even those whose work is related to fossils, who were considered the target of the poster, probably won’t feel guilty after seeing the poster. That’s because it’s not them, at least not only them use petrol fuel. Moreover, as a poster, the author of it must hope more people can be influenced, instead of just the fossil-industry-related. So the opinion that the poster aims at people in petrol-related fields is not so persuasive than it targets all modern people. </p>
<p>By way of conclusion, the poster uses different ways to raise the sympathy and guilty of viewers to motivate modern people to use less fossil fuel. The poster, also WWF, doesn’t care who is truly responsible, but they want to influence people emotionally and motivate them into actions. Crutzen, Malm, and WWF work for the same purpose——saving our Earth. Although the painting may cover some facts and neglect other reasons causing ocean pollution, which is reverse its purpose, it does appeal to modern people to do their bit and has a good effect.</p>

You have avoided a lot of trouble!</p>
<p>First, you should set up a place for your blog to be stored on your computer. You can create a folder somewhere on your computer.</p>
<p>Then, you should go to the folder in the terminal (using the command cd).</p>
<p>Next, type in the command <code>npm install -g hexo-cli</code></p>
<p>Notice that <code>-g</code> is an alternative parameter, which means installing Hexo globally. And <code>-cli</code> allows you to use command lines to operate Hexo.</p>
<h4 id="Verification-2"><a href="#Verification-2" class="headerlink" title="Verification:"></a>Verification:</h4><p>Type in the code <code>hexo -v</code> in the terminal. If the version number and some other information are returned, you’ve successfully installed Hexo.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/12/315d114f6d094e0b.png"></p>
<h4 id="Default"><a href="#Default" class="headerlink" title="Default:"></a>Default:</h4><p><code>npm ERR! code EPERM</code><br><code>npm ERR! errno -4048</code></p>
<p>If these kinds of results occurred during your installation, you can find if there are some .npmrc documents generated. Remember, the extra .npmrc should not be what is in your “blog” folder. Instead, try to find these files in <code>C:\Users\YourUserName</code>.</p>
<p>If you do have solved the problems above but still can’t install, it might be that you’re not permitted. To solve it, you can open the WindowsPowerShell in your folder (remember to choose “Run as Administrator” ).</p>
<p>If the two ways cannot solve your problem, you may use the downloaded package to uninstall Node.js and install it again. This actually works even it sounds a bit irrelevant.</p>
<h4 id="Initialize-Hexo"><a href="#Initialize-Hexo" class="headerlink" title="Initialize Hexo"></a>Initialize Hexo</h4><p>Type in the code <code>hexo init</code> in the terminal can initialize your blog. Remember, you should be under the folder of your blog in the terminal when you commit to this command.</p>
<p>Wait for things being downloaded to your folder. If some errors occurred, check if you can connect GitHub. Simply typing in the initializing code again can be helpful.</p>
<h4 id="periodical-achievement"><a href="#periodical-achievement" class="headerlink" title="periodical achievement"></a>periodical achievement</h4><p>To see what you have done after so many steps, you can run <code>hexo s</code> to let your computer act as a server temporarily. </p>
<p><img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/12/228666cc2c61d738.png"></p>
<p>Type the address “localhost:4000” in a browser and you’ll see your initialized Hexo page.</p>
<p>The initialized page will look like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/12/fe272694b3daa190.png"></p>
<h3 id="4-Set-up-a-personal-repository-in-GitHub"><a href="#4-Set-up-a-personal-repository-in-GitHub" class="headerlink" title="4. Set up a personal repository in GitHub"></a>4. Set up a personal repository in GitHub</h3><p>Go to your own GitHub page (if you don’t have an account, just sign up for one and follow the instructions).</p>
<p>Choose the “Repositories” and click the new in green (in the right upper corner in this screenshot).</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/12/c98f49716ba6faf7.png"></p>
<p>Remember to set the name of the repository as YourGitHubName.github.io. (For example, my GitHub account is Nephrn17, so the repository’s name is Nephren17.github.io) This can help you avoid later troubles.</p>
<h3 id="5-Generate-an-SSH-and-add-it-to-GitHub"><a href="#5-Generate-an-SSH-and-add-it-to-GitHub" class="headerlink" title="5. Generate an SSH and add it to GitHub"></a>5. Generate an SSH and add it to GitHub</h3><p>After creating your own GitHub repository, you should link the repository with the blog on your computer. This is done by adding the SSH to GitHub. Open your blog’s folder, click in with the right button, then git bash here.</p>
<p> First, you should config your account. You can type the code in Git bash like this:</p>
<p><code>git config --global user.name &quot;your GitHub user name&quot;</code></p>
<p><code>git config --global user.email &quot;your GitHub account&#39;s email&quot;</code></p>
<p>After that, you can create your SSH.</p>
<p><code>ssh-keygen -t rsa -C &quot;your GitHub account&#39;s email&quot;</code></p>
<p>In fact, you can type nothing to create an SSH and that’s OK.</p>
<p>After that, a file is created to store the SSH. You can find it in C:\Users\YourUserName\.ssh. There’ll be a file named “id_rsa.pub”. Open the file and copy all the content. (Ctrl+A and Ctrl+C is recommended) Then paste the content to the GitHub page.</p>
<p><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/img_convert/3194ad0a9d04d94c09485122932968f3.png"></p>
<p>The “Title” is not important and you can choose anything you like to name it. Pate what you copied in the “Key”.</p>
<p>To verify if you succeeded, you can type <code>ssh -T git@github.com</code> to test.</p>
<h3 id="6-Deploy-Hexo-to-GitHub"><a href="#6-Deploy-Hexo-to-GitHub" class="headerlink" title="6. Deploy Hexo to  GitHub"></a>6. Deploy Hexo to  GitHub</h3><p>Open the _config.yml file and change it a little bit. (You may need a VSCode to modify it. Some other alternatives are also OK.) You can find what is shown in the picture at the end of this file.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/12/14204663ef6e34a2.png"></p>
<p>Notice that the “repository” should be your repository’s address (Not mine). Other things can</p>
<p> be simply copied.</p>
<p>Then, you need to install deploy-git to enable you to deploy what you have written on your computer to your GitHub </p>
<p>repository. Open the git bash in your blog’s file. The installation is quite simple by typing in a command:</p>
<p><code>npm install hexo-deployer-git --save</code></p>
<p>Then you can see what you have done by typing these commands:</p>
<p><code>hexo g</code></p>
<p><code>hexo d</code></p>
<p>If things go wrong in this step, still, it is probably caused by the network connection problems. You can now visit your website “<a href="http://www.yourgithubusername.github.io&quot;/">www.YourGitHubUserName.github.io&quot;</a> and it is your website.</p>
<p>Note:  for <code>hexo g</code>, the “g” stands for “generate”; for <code>hexo d</code>, the “d” stands for “deploy”. For more information about the command lines, you can use the code <code>hexo -h</code> or visit the official website: <a href="https://hexo.io/zh-cn/docs/commands">https://hexo.io/zh-cn/docs/commands</a></p>
<h3 id="7-Issue-Articles"><a href="#7-Issue-Articles" class="headerlink" title="7. Issue Articles"></a>7. Issue Articles</h3><p>To issue an article, you can write in the command line: <code>hexo new &quot;your article&#39;s name&quot; </code> and  YourArticleName.md file will be generated in your “source” folder. You can change the file as you like to be the content of your blog. Then, you still need <code>hexo g</code> and <code>hexo d</code> to deploy it to your GitHub repository.  If nothing is changed, you can simply do that again.</p>
<p>Some websites may suggest you use a <code>hexo clean</code> first. But this command may clear what you written before. So I suggest that if simply two commands are enough to reach your goal, there’s no need to add an extra one.</p>
<p>If you want to see what your article would be like before posting it, similarly, you can use <code>hexo s</code> and visit the local website. Remember, don’t use Ctrl+c to copy as this is meant to stop the program in the Git environment.</p>

<h3 id="8-Other-things-you-can-do-to-make-your-blog-more-interesting"><a href="#8-Other-things-you-can-do-to-make-your-blog-more-interesting" class="headerlink" title="8. Other things you can do to make your blog more interesting"></a>8. Other things you can do to make your blog more interesting</h3><p>To make your blog more interesting, there’re many things that you can do. You can add a lot of plugins and themes to make your blog more attractive.</p>
<p>For plugins, you can visit the official website: <a href="https://hexo.io/plugins/">https://hexo.io/plugins/</a> Actually, we have installed some plugins like hexo-cli and hexo-deployer-git. As all plugins process their own unique function, it’s a wiser choice to explore the world of plugins yourself.</p>
<p>For themes, you can find piles of them also on the official website and GitHub. The official website: <a href="https://hexo.io/themes/">https://hexo.io/themes/</a> The default theme is landscape. To change one, you need to download one first. You can go to chosen theme’s Github page and then clone its address.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/12/164467d891213693.png"></p>
<p>Click the copy button like what’s on the right side of the picture.  Then type <code>git clone https://github.com/liuyib/hexo-theme-stun.git</code>. (You can choose a different theme by doing what is similar).</p>
<p>The theme this blog is using is called diaspora, and you can find it easily on GitHub.</p>
