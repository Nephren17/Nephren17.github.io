<h2 id="Speech-Draft"><a href="#Speech-Draft" class="headerlink" title="Speech Draft"></a>Speech Draft</h2><p>The speech draft is shown as below:</p>
<h4 id="Page-1"><a href="#Page-1" class="headerlink" title="Page 1"></a>Page 1</h4><p>Today we will talk about animation and music. Today we don’t want to discuss whether animation is art. We can suppose it is if we see animation as an extension as movie, which is now widely considered movie. Today we want to talk about the relationship between two art: animation and it’s music. I don’t want to use background music, as sometimes it may ont only be background. Now you may be at a loss about what I’m going to say, so let me give you some example first.</p>
<h4 id="Page-2"><a href="#Page-2" class="headerlink" title="Page 2"></a>Page 2</h4><p>Let’s do what we did in class: Please listen to a piece of music and tell me what can you see.</p>
<p>Now what’s in your mind? You can share your answers with me in the chatbox.</p>
<p>In my mind, there is a flying cat like this —— yes, it’s Tom.</p>
<h4 id="Page-3"><a href="#Page-3" class="headerlink" title="Page 3"></a>Page 3</h4><p>If you haven’t seen Tom and Jerry or are completely at a loss what I’m talking about, don’t worry. Let’s see this piece of video.</p>
<h4 id="Page-4"><a href="#Page-4" class="headerlink" title="Page 4"></a>Page 4</h4><p>(video).</p>
<h4 id="Page-5"><a href="#Page-5" class="headerlink" title="Page 5"></a>Page 5</h4><p>So now you may have a better understanding about today’s topic. We want to discuss the relationship between the music and the animation. We’ll go from imitation to representation, then to some Hume’s and Benjamin’s idea. After that, we’ll show another example of the art of combination.</p>
<h4 id="Page-6"><a href="#Page-6" class="headerlink" title="Page 6"></a>Page 6</h4><p>So let’s first come to the question: is this imitation. I mean, in class, we know the music is imitation elephant, birds, and other animals. We can say ,the piece of piano is imitating the action of Tom. The fast-paced music represent Tom’s hard-work of getting himself into the sky. The joyful tune is what Tom feels when he discovered a way to fly.</p>
<p>However, is this the real case? When we look at what the music is, we found we went on a wrong way. This is a piece of classic piano composed by Chopin, much earlier than Tom.</p>
<p>Can Tom imitating the music? Of course not. The animation is not aimed at imitation Chopin but amuse viewers.</p>
<p>Of course you can I don’t care. I know it is interesting, that’s enough. But we now want to find a theory that can explain why it is interesting.</p>
<p>Let’s throw this idea into rubbish bin.</p>
<h4 id="Page-7"><a href="#Page-7" class="headerlink" title="Page 7"></a>Page 7</h4><p>Now we move on to representation. Still, who represents who? The word here is quite confusing here, as represent is a verb. Now, we change it to the music can be a representation of the animation. This is the case happened to the viewers, as for me, I thought of Tom at hearing the music. So who make the music able to represent Tom? Of course not Chopin as he didn’t know Tom. We can say it is the producer of the animation. He\She combines the music with the animation to make Chopin’s piano be a representation. But why do viewers take his idea? I mean, why viewers accept? If I want to say, Tom can reprsent SJTU or JI, you will not accept my idea.</p>
<p>We know Lotus is not Bourbon Dynasty but it can represent it. As they show something common. Similarly, Tom’s action shares something with this piece of piano.</p>
<h4 id="Page-8"><a href="#Page-8" class="headerlink" title="Page 8"></a>Page 8</h4><p>This idea is what Hume agrees.  He has a interesting comment: “The abstract philosophy of Cicero isn’t believed today; the power of his oratory still wins our admiration”. He means people of different era can appreciate the same art. Why? We found that in the “standard of taste”, the word “general” is used 22 times. He believe art is a concept that something general among humans. To make one’s taste better, he\she need to taste art from different era and cultures to make his taste sensitive. This implies that there are something common  about art. </p>
<p>Like in this case, the music shares the fast-pacing and fantasy feeling. Also they shares a happy feeling. Maybe the feeling of flying. Want to fly is a deep-rooted human wish. Maybe so are cats. If we take art as a concept, the animation and the music are both the representation of the concept? The idea seems familiar? Now we take back Polato’s idea from the rubbish bin and see. If art is a concept, then both the music and animation are both imitating it. We can see the concept as the cilinder in the middile, and music and animation are two projection of it.</p>
<p>So what’s the art effect combine the two different things? How can the two art affecting each other?</p>
<p>We first see the second question through the reproduction theory.</p>
<h4 id="Page-9"><a href="#Page-9" class="headerlink" title="Page 9"></a>Page 9</h4><p>First of course, the animation helped the classic music be more democratic, as I believe most of us, if have listened piece of music, mostly is because of Tom and Jerry.</p>
<p>The deeper reason is the animation represents the music in a more public way. It successfully turns a fine art into a understandable even children. It cultivates the public’s taste to understand a classic.</p>
<p>For animation the music helped it to present the feeling of flying and make the atmosphere more enjoyable.</p>
<p>In this example, the music and animation only focuses on the feeling of flying, but in other cases, choosing music can have some deeper meaning. Let’s look at another example.</p>
<p>So what’s the art effect combine the two different things? </p>
<h4 id="Page-10"><a href="#Page-10" class="headerlink" title="Page 10"></a>Page 10</h4><p>Let us look at the animation called Suka Suka, or World End.</p>
<p>It is a fantasy story. In the story, humans  and all creatures on the ground are destroyed by some beasts. The surviving races now make their homes, towns, and cities up on floating islands in the sky to escape Beasts on the ground. Only a group of elfs are weapons to defend the beasts as they have special strength.</p>
<p>A human —— who accidentally survived the disaster but lost all his family, became the administrator of the elfs. He fell in love with an elf, who finally sacrifice herself to save the floating world.</p>
<p>In the animation, the song Scarbrough’s Fair is used twice, one at the beginning and another at the end. Lets now watch a short part of the beginning. </p>
<h4 id="Page-11"><a href="#Page-11" class="headerlink" title="Page 11"></a>Page 11</h4><p>“Scarborough Fair” is composed in Scotland 13th century. It’s lyric talks about unrequited love. A young man requests impossible tasks from his lover, saying that if she can perform them, he will take her back.</p>
<h4 id="Page-12"><a href="#Page-12" class="headerlink" title="Page 12"></a>Page 12</h4><p>In the animation, the Scarborough Fair at the beginning gives the viewers a felling of fantasy and a bit sorrow. The style of the animation fits the song very well and pull viewers into the fiction world and ancient time.</p>
<p>The plot seems to give some explanation of the lyrics. Maybe the man loves the woman, and he knows he wouldn’t come, so he gives the woman such uncompletable requirements. In the animation, the man and his lover also never met again, and they know they probably cannot stay together for too long. The background of war and disaster is the same for the song and the anime. </p>
<h4 id="Page-13"><a href="#Page-13" class="headerlink" title="Page 13"></a>Page 13</h4><p>The combination gives us a chance to connect the old story. As we said, “Whatever has happened before will happen again. “ The things happened in history can also happen in fictions. And people’s emotion are the same. The animation can be a explanation, a representation of the song. The same, the song can be a representation. Note that it is can be, but not is a representation. The animation explained the song in a completely different era.</p>
<p>The art effect is we viewers are put into a feeling of time. This is a eternal topic of human beings, love and war. The music amplifies viewers’ emotion towards the tragedy. To make the whole effect better, the music’s tune is changed in different parts. In the beginning, as we heard, the music is quite Melodious, but when in the end , Scarbrough’s Fair was changed into a sorrow tune. The change of tune is not only a representation of the multi-face of the song, also the change of emotions of characters.</p>
<p>In this case, the story of the song is closely connected with the theme of the animation. Conclusively, the art effect represents as it can better move the audiences and make the love tragedy have more sense of time. We can be completely absorbed into the story.</p>

<h4 id="Page-15"><a href="#Page-15" class="headerlink" title="Page 15"></a>Page 15</h4><p>My presentation end here. I like Tom and Jerry and Suka Suka myself very much. If you have questions, don’t hesitate to ask me.</p>

    <title>A View from the Adaptation of Hayate the Combat Butler: Art of Different Forms</title>
    <url>/2022/10/04/A-View-from-the-Adaptation-of-Hayate-the-Combat-Butler-Art-of-Different-Forms/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>​    Nowadays, we are very familiar with the concept of adaptation: films adapted from novels, TV series adapted from comics, and so on. Among them, the adaption from comic to animation is quite prevalent. If we consider animation as art, what’s the relationship between it and the original comic? From neo-formalism, we know “the form of an art and the importance of representational content” should also be equally emphasized (Carroll, 130). What happens when an adapted version represents the theme of the original one? As formalism cares about how art is represented as form, can there be a better one?</p>
<p>​    If both can be viewed as art, the original comic and the adapted animation should both show the theme, which may be the aboutness in the formalism theory, very well with different forms and advantages (Carroll, 27). Animation and the comic shouldn’t be compared and can both perform very well in showing the theme even in different visual and presentational methods. </p>
<p>​    We can examine the principle with <em>Hayate the Combat Butler</em>, an animation and a comic that shares the same name, and see how it works. The comic and the animation tell about the amusing daily life of Nagi Sanzenin and her butler, Hayate Ayasaki. The comic and the animation are both quite popular, as the comic had serialized for thirteen years (a very long time for a comic) and the animation includes four seasons and about 100 episodes (which is also an unusual length for animation). The long duration of time can show its great popularity. As commented by Allen Moody, “I got several good laughs out of every episode in Season One, and almost every episode in Season Two.” (Moody). The comic and animation’s purpose concerns the interesting things in daily life. So how can comics and animation be successful and unique with the same theme?</p>
<p>​    The animation adapts the comic while adding new features. The comic emphasized every moment, which means the character’s expression and behavior at a certain moment are recorded. The style of drawing can be extremely exaggerated, expressing the idea well.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgtg.com/image/mwsrC"><img src="https://i.imgtg.com/2022/10/04/mwsrC.png" alt="mwsrC.png"></a></p>
<p>Nagi’s (right) shocking expression (<em>Hayate the Combat Butler</em> Vol.328, 20)</p>
<p>​    For example, the image is aimed at showing the thickness of Nagi, whose face has been almost filled with her mouth. We can also notice Nagi’s body is out of proportion with her head, which also helps show her surprise.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgtg.com/image/mwVQL"><img src="https://i.imgtg.com/2022/10/04/mwVQL.png" alt="mwVQL.png"></a></p>
<p>Nagi’s expression in the context (<em>Hayate the Combat Butler</em> Vol.328, 20)</p>
<p>​    Besides the tricks mentioned above, when being put into the context, a certain image can be emphasized through typesetting. In this example, Nagi’s expression takes the place of two images, making her more eye-catching.</p>
<p>​    The comic specializes in dealing with every scene, trying to make every character expressive and present their characters and features. All the scenes and characters from everyday life and all constitute what wanted to be expressed: the common everyday life itself is already interesting enough.</p>
<p>​    On the other hand, the adapted animation does use similar expressions to make some scenes expressive.</p>
<p>   <a href="https://imgtg.com/image/mwYCi"><img src="https://i.imgtg.com/2022/10/04/mwYCi.png" alt="mwYCi.png"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://imgtg.com/image/mwliX"><img src="https://i.imgtg.com/2022/10/04/mwliX.png" alt="mwliX.png"></a></p>
<p>A screenshot from <em>Hayate the Combat Butler: Cuties</em> (Left) and A similar expression in comic (Right) (<em>Hayate the Combat Butler</em> Vol.324, 8)</p>
<p>​    However, the animation cannot use tricks such as changing the size of the image. Besides, as animation is played during a period, the image on the left can only be one scene and last for only a few seconds, making it less impressive to viewers. Also, when we consider the whole work, as the production of animation can be much higher than a comic, the animation can only include a reduced amount of the comic. It seems these factors can make animation perform not so well in presenting interesting things in daily life, which is emphasized by the comic.</p>
<p>​    Well, the analysis above is only using a comic point of view to see the animation. We can only say animation didn’t do so well in presenting the interesting things of daily life in a moment style. What the form of animation can do is continuously tell viewers the whole story. All the things are presented in a 20-minute episode with a very clear timeline, making it more appealing and easy to understand. Besides, as an adapted version of the comic, the animation can tell the whole story in a smoother timeline and continuous way. In the fourth season of <em>Hayate the Combat Butler</em>, we can notice the animation is telling things in a biographic way, telling some stories only of a single character. This means the animation completely changes the sequence of the comic to give viewers a better sight of what happened in the character’s daily life.</p>
<p>​    Another strength of animation is that it is colored, which looks more similar to reality and makes viewers tend to accept what happened in it Take the image below as an example, we can notice that the sunlight is projected on Nagi’s head and clothing, which in the image are shown in different colors. Light and shades are widely used to make the 2-D form possess some 3-D features and be more real. The realness does not express the theme better, but it can make it easier for viewers to accept what is expressed.</p>
<p> <a href="https://imgtg.com/image/mw94t"><img src="https://i.imgtg.com/2022/10/04/mw94t.png" alt="mw94t.png"></a></p>
<p>A scene where the light and shade can be clearly shown</p>
<p>​    From the analysis, we found that animation and comics can both express representational ideas well from different aspects. This relationship between the two reminds me of Plato’s allegory of Cave. According to Plato, “prisoners are shown projections of puppets onto the wall, which is considered as an imitation of the puppets” (Plato, 1132). In this way, animation and comics are two projections of the same puppet, aboutness. So if we completely take this theory, there exists a form that is more “similar” or better represents the theme. But this is not the case. In the example of <em>Hayate the Combat Butler</em>, both the two forms perform very well and serve the purpose of bringing laughter to viewers.</p>
<p>​    The problem in the previous metaphor is that it takes the “aboutness” in formalism theory as a fixed object waiting to be imitated or represented. As in a comic, the theme is expressed in the process of the comic or animation goes on, and the metaphor can be modified into that the theme is no longer a single point but a direction. We can say the “imitation idea” understands the theme as a point and the form as a path. The best form can be decided by which path goes nearest to the theme. But the real case, at least in comics and animation similar to <em>Hayate the Combat Butler</em>, its theme is not a point that needs to be reached, interesting things are hiding in the process of story-telling, every scene of the comic, and every minute of the animation. If each form is still a path, then what it wants to express is a direction. The Adapted version only goes a different route. With adapted characters and plots, animation decides how to go through the route rather than which direction to go or which way to go. Of course, the original comic can influence the way for the animation to go, which includes the plot and the characters, but they are two different things. The theme is contained, or represented in every episode or scene and leads the whole storyline just like every step of the path can show the direction and the direction is the big picture of the whole path.</p>
<p>​    A point that needs to be clarified is that this does not mean the form that goes further is better. Truly, it can be deduced from neo-formalism that the form that represents the theme better is better. But in the metaphor, it’s no meaning in saying whether a route can represent the direction better. That’s because art is not a metaphor, it is art. Different forms of art cannot be compared, as they are different routes starting from different origins. In the case of comics and animation, every single form can be adjusted to make the representation better, for example, the animation can be added with more details. But separately, they cannot be compared with each other. Art of different forms can reach its own best state, but there are no “best among best states of different forms. They are isolated.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the animation and the comic can perform very well in reaching the author’s goal and be considered art. For each form, its theme is not a destination but something that is shown in the process of appreciation. Different forms can have something in common, such as the storyline and characters, but they cannot be compared by which form represents its theme better.</p>

    <title>Inequality: From Jensen to Normed Vector Space</title>
    <url>/2021/12/29/Inequality-From-Jensen-to-Normed-Vector-Space/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/12/0854eba989cd10ce.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The article can be mainly separated into 6 parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>About what is required to be a normed vector space</li>
<li>Start from Jensen Inequality</li>
<li>From Jensen’s inequality to Hölder’s inequality</li>
<li>From Hölder’s inequality to Minkowski’s Inequality</li>
<li>What these inequalities mean when combined with normed vector space</li>
<li>When p goes to infinity</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="1-About-what-is-required-to-be-a-normed-vector-space"><a href="#1-About-what-is-required-to-be-a-normed-vector-space" class="headerlink" title="1. About what is required to be a normed vector space"></a>1. About what is required to be a normed vector space</h3><p>A vector space, or a linear space, is a set of objects which can be added and multiplied by scalars. The operation of addition and multiplication should follow a set of specific rules. For more detailed information, you can visit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space</a>.</p>
<p>For normed vector space, some additional requirements should be added. For a space, of course, we want to measure the distance between two elements. But, how can we measure? And is there any requirement for our method to measure?</p>
<p>In a normal way, we can define a distance for a 3-dimension space like that the distance between (a,b) and (c,d) is </p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\sqrt{(a-c)^2+(b-d)^2}</script><p>However, this can be easily changed if I want to invent a new way to measure distance. Using the same example, I can also set my distance like this:</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\sqrt[3]{(a-b)^3+(c-d)^3}</script><p>No one can say this is problematic. So, what is distance, or what should it be like?</p>
<p>Well, mathematicians say that you can define a “distance” as long as it meets 3 requirements: (We denote distance as ∥ · ∥， and said V and U to be elements of the vector space)</p>
<ol>
<li>∥V∥ ≥ 0 and ∥V∥ = 0 if and only if V = 0;</li>
<li>For all the scalars a, ∥a · V∥ = |a| · ∥V∥</li>
<li>∥U + V∥ ≤ ∥U∥ + ∥V∥</li>
</ol>
<p>We can discover that the third one is the hardest to be satisfied. However, there’s an interesting discovery: For all p belonging to natural numbers, these distances always meets the requirements: (U and V can be respectively written as (u1,u2,···, un) and (v1,v2,···,vn))</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\sqrt[p]{(u_1-v_1)^p+(u_2-v_2)^p+······+(u_n-v_n)^p}</script><p>This is even true when p goes to infinity. What happens and why?</p>
<h3 id="2-Start-from-Jensen-Inequality"><a href="#2-Start-from-Jensen-Inequality" class="headerlink" title="2. Start from Jensen Inequality"></a>2. Start from Jensen Inequality</h3><p>When a function is convex, we can apply Jensen’s Inequality to it. It estimates the properties of convex functions by assuming they behave linearly. </p>
<p>Jensen’s Inequality tells us that, for a convex function f(x) (whose domain is [a,b]), and x1,x2,…,xn∈[a,b], we can know that</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\frac{f(x_1)+f(x_2)+···+f(x_n)}{n}\ge f(\frac{x_1+x_2+···+x_n}{n})</script><p>Similarly, you can get the reverse result if f(x) is a concave function.</p>

From Jensen’s inequality to Hölder’s inequality"></a>3. From Jensen’s inequality to Hölder’s inequality</h3><p>First, we need to know what’s Hölder’s inequality. Hölder’s inequality can be written as:</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\sum_{i=1}^n |x_jy_j| \le (\sum_{j=1}^n |x_j|^p)^{\frac{1}{p}}(\sum_{j=1}^n |x_j|^q)^{\frac{1}{q}}</script><p>p and q should satisfy that p∈N and 1/p +1/q =1.</p>
<h5 id="Proof"><a href="#Proof" class="headerlink" title="Proof:"></a>Proof:</h5><p>let </p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\widetilde x_i=\frac{|x_i|}{\sqrt[p]{\sum_{j=1}^n |x_i|^p}},\space\space\space\widetilde y_i=\frac{|y_i|}{\sqrt[p]{\sum_{j=1}^n |y_i|^p}}</script><p>We can discover for Jensen’s inequality that</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\prod_{i=1}^n a_i^{\lambda_i} \le \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_ia_i\space\space\space\space\space\space    (\sum\lambda_i=1)</script><p>(which is easy to be proved by applying a log function on the RHS. Note that log function is concave and you can apply Jensen’s inequality to it)</p>
<p>According to the upward formula, we can deduce that</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">

    <title>A View from “The Phonographs Record”: Phonographs are not only Machines</title>
    <url>/2022/04/30/A-View-from-%E2%80%9CThe-Phonographs-Record%E2%80%9D-Phonographs-are-not-only-Machines/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://gimg2.baidu.com/image_search/src=http%3A%2F%2Fm.huanghelou.cc%2Fzb_users%2Fupload%2F2020%2F03%2F20200321115901_38515.jpg&amp;refer=http%3A%2F%2Fm.huanghelou.cc&amp;app=2002&amp;size=f9999,10000&amp;q=a80&amp;n=0&amp;g=0n&amp;fmt=auto?sec=1653918991&amp;t=864571c3c3160dc1ab6ae89b0674f2d1" alt=""></p>
<p>In 1821, English Scientist Michael Faraday produced the first motor. From then on, electricity began to enter every field of people’s life. With the development of the knowledge of the electromagnetic field, electricity finally entered the music field in about 1900. In 1877, the phonograph was invented; in 1897, the radio was invented; in 1907, the first radio broadcast was conducted. With the advent of these new inventions, the way that people listen to music was completely changed.</p>
<p>In China, the 1900s is not only a period when phonographs appeared but also a time when western culture was introduced, a time when the country’s regime was significantly changing, a time when war and peace were frequently replaced. In that period, a debate in literature and art occurred. People hold different opinions on why should artworks and articles be created, whether it is a way for authors to make money or should it promote revolution. Leftists, who believe authors are responsible for promoting revolution, criticized some authors for only focused on the commercial value of their works. The debate on phonographs can be a clear lens to reflect this debate on literature. </p>
<p>Leftists, most of which advocate revolution, promote using phonographs as tools for revolution and criticize capitalists for only using phonographs as entertaining commodities. In their view, Zhou Shoujuan, the author of “The phonograph Record”, is a typical author of Mandarin Duck and Butterfly School, a school that mainly produces popular literature for entertainment. So people, especially the left-wing authors, consider Zhou and his school only to focus on entertainment. However, in “The Phonograph Record”, Zhou proposed a view other than his school and the leftists on phonographs. In his story, phonographs are living things and spokesmen for the human souls, instead of machines to be sold or help the revolution.</p>
<p>In the 1920s, it is natural for most people to consider phonographs as commodities. This trend can be shown by the experience of Fred Gaisberg, a star scout working for G&amp;T company. According to the second part of <em>Gaisberg’s diary</em> edited by Hugo Strötbaum, Gaisberg’s team had recorded 325 records until March 27th, 1903 (47). According to statistics in <em>Between Entertainment and Revolution: Gramophones, Records and Cultural Transfer in Republican China</em> by Andreas Steen, on average, they recorded 32 records a day, a huge amount at that time (64). Most of these records are finally sold back to China after being produced in Britain. Pathé, Beka, G&amp;T, and many other phonograph record companies are also active during that period (67-79).</p>
<p>This trend is also mentioned in Zhou’s story. An interesting fact is that the aim of Andrew Jones, the translator of the story, to translate the story is to show the influence of the Pathé company in China. As he argued in <em>Yellow Music:</em> <em>media culture and colonial modernity in the Chinese jazz age</em>, “Such was the dominance, both real and imagined, of Pathé that when the hero of a late 1920s Zhou Shoujuan short story, ‘Phonograph Record’, wants to record his last words for his lost love in Shanghai, he calls for the manager of the local Pathé branch office, even though he is living on a fanciful Isle of Regret situated in the middle of the Pacific” (164). This can also show that people at that time sees phonographs and sound as commodities, as there existed companies that are specifically profiting through selling records.</p>
<p>The reason for people holding the perspective that phonographs and records are commercial lies in the easy “repetition” created by phonographs. “Repetition”, the concept raised in <em>Noise: The Political Economy of Music</em> by Jacque Attali, means how a piece of voice or music can be produced repeatedly (87). In the past, “repetition” can only be done through the repetitive performances of artists, making music cannot be an easy “exchange and profit” (Attali 88). However, phonographs can change this situation and make “repetition” easy and cheap, thus enabling people to sell a piece of sound.</p>
<p>However, the leftists at that time raised a different opinion. Phonographs, in their eyes, are good tools to inspire people to participate in the revolution. This trend can be also clearly seen in Guo Moruo’s “Phonograph Theory”. According to Andrew Jones’s <em>Yellow Music</em>, Guo hoped that music composers in China “be phonographs”, which means they should listen to the need of the mass, compose them into music, and then use the music to inspire the mass to conduct a revolution (107). A typical “phonograph” composer listed by Jones is Nie Er, the composer of China’s national anthem (105). According to Jones, Nie Er was moved by the mass’s strong desire to get rid of the Feudal bureaucrats and foreign invaders, so he devoted himself to “recording” the mass’s voices and composing songs to inspire the mass (105-107). As Guo and Nie are both famous and influential authors and composers at that time, their theories and experience are representative of people at that time. From the description, we can notice that phonographs are still seen as a tool, whose aim is no longer money but revolution. As this point of view still, focus on the function of the phonograph without noticing the meaning of the phonograph, the leftists are likely to consider that phonographs are still seen as commodities in Zhou’s story.</p>
<p>There’re reasons for leftists to consider phonographs a good helper for revolution. They took advantage of the easy “repetition” of phonographs not to “exchange and profit” like capitalists, but to spread ideology. For them, easier “repetition” means a faster and wider spread of ideas. In the specific era when China is changing from a federal society to a modern society, the ideology most necessary to be spread was about revolution. So leftists would take phonographs as tools to serve the revolution.</p>
<p>In this context of history, Zhou raised a third voice. Sound and phonographs are no longer tools, but spokesmen for souls, things that can express emotion and act like humans.</p>
<p>In “The Phonograph Record”, Qin Jiesheng and Lin Qianyu fell in love with each other, but they are not allowed to marry each other because of their families (82). Qin was sad when he knew Lin finally married another man which was appointed by Lin’s family and he went to an island full of those who were disappointed in love (84-85). On that island, most people were having parties all day long to relieve their sorrows, but Qin choose to spend his time alone and never talk to others (85-86). Qin had watched the waves and thought about Lin all day long until he was too sick and finally died there. Before his death, he recorded his last voice and send the phonograph record to Lin (87). After hearing Qin’s voice, Lin can’t control her emotions toward Qin and kept communicating with the record. She finally passed away because of lovesickness (89-90).</p>
<p>In the story, phonographs and sounds are more than a tool for the man and the woman. Qin, the man, made a record, instead of writing a letter, to express his emotion to the woman before he died (Zhou 87). The women “shed[s] tears for each word that emerged from the machine”, and “sa[ys] many many things to the record” (Zhou 90). After the death of the man, Lin also did consider the record as the man himself, as she even tried to communicate with the record (Zhou 90). We can notice that the phonograph and record are viewed not as dead machines, but as holy and living things.</p>
<p>There are objective reasons for Lin to believe the phonograph was the man. According to <em>The Audible Past: Cultural Origins of Sound Reproduction</em> written by Jonathan Stern, phonographs provide listeners “a private acoustic space” where people can be isolated from the outside (Stern 153). However, from this perspective, “private” does not mean they can own the sound as a commodity, but they can hear the sound alone. In this private space, people can enjoy themselves without being exposed to the outside. Privatization, or being alone enables people to separate listening from other senses, thus making the experience of listening better (Stern 154). In Zhou’s story, he mentioned that “From that time on, as soon as Qianyu saw that her husband had gone out, she would immediately lock the door and listen to the phonograph record” (Zhou, 90). Qianyu’s behavior of locking the door creates a private space, making her more focused on the man’s record, thus more believing that the man is communicating with her (Zhou 89). Without being known by others, Qianyu tends to believe things that are mysterious and impossible, like a dead person can talk to her (Zhou 90).</p>
<p>Another objective reason is that phonographs also provide a “stereo image”, which means a 3-D image, to convince people that what they heard is real instead of a record (Stern 155). According to Stern, the sound heard from the left ear and right ear is “slightly different”, so listeners can “get a three-dimensional sense” (Stern 155). Although maybe the original purpose of being private is to profit commercially, this does help raise the quality of the sound. As listeners put most of their attention on hearing when they’re in a private space, they believe they’re facing something real when the sound is steric and 3-D (Stern 159). In Zhou’s story, the private space can provide the phonograph with an environment to produce steric sound, which may persuade the woman into believing the man is standing in front of her.</p>
<p>Besides the objective and technique reasons above, people’s cognitive habits may affect their behavior. The phenomenon can partly be caused by people’s tendency to treat what they are unfamiliar with as something mysterious. As a new technique, phonographs are magical to the mass that knew little about how phonographs worked. Similar ideas that see the phonograph as something holy can also be found in western literature. In “Death and the Shell”, a French story written by Maurice Renard, the narrator, and his friend, Nerval, feel sad after hearing the record of one of their dead friend’s voices (51). Then, they heard the sound of a shell and came up with an idea that what they heard is what the shell heard just before its death. Both two sounds imply the deep connection between sound and life (54). Sound is given a holy understanding relating to the dead and living people. What deserves noticing is that Renard published this story in 1907, thirteen years before Zhou published his story. The phonograph is also a technique first invented in the west and then introduced into China. We can deduce that the idea is partly caused by people’s unfamiliarity with phonographs.</p>
<p>However, only the technical and objective reasons above are not enough to persuade someone to see a machine as a human. In the story, Zhou particularly mentioned that “A letter might be able to convey my meaning, but not my voice. She always loved listening to the phonograph, so I think I would like to make a record of my voice and send it to her.” (Zhou 88). So there must exist a deeper cultural reason for people to prioritize sound. We can notice that in western culture, people tend to believe voice is holy and living. This can be explained by the theory in <em>The Soundscape</em> by R. Murray Schafer, that we always give priority to the ear (Schafer 101). He mentioned that before Renaissance, God is only described by music and had never been portrayed. This fact can show that people in the west had long seen hearing as a more prioritized sense (Schafer 101). From this point, sound and voice are the symbols of humanity and god, not in Attali’s words, “[a] material object of exchange and profit” (Attali 88). In the 20th century, the spread of Christianity and western culture also influenced the Chinese. This trend can also be reflected in the story. Zhou mentioned that “Qianyu began to suspect that he had taken his own life, but then she recalled that he had been a Christian” (Zhou 87). The deep-rooted western influence can lead to the trend of the sanctification of phonographs.</p>
<p>When considering the purpose of Zhou to create the story, many people, most leftists believe this is only for entertainment. There’re reasons for them to think so, as Zhou’s school do mainly produced popular literature and is widely welcomed among the mass. Most authors in the school believe literature is only entertainment and their aim of writing books is to earn money. However, the leftists didn’t accept this opinion. From Guo’s phonograph theory and Nie Er’s personal experience described in <em>Yellow Music</em>, we can know that the leftists believe that not only phonographs, but composers should also serve the revolution (Jones 105). They promoted that articles should be written to serve the era. In their opinions, as the revolution was the most important thing in that era, all articles should focus on the theme. So it was natural for the left-wing authors to criticize authors in Zhou’s school as “only focused on entertainment” and believe this story is also one of the entertaining works.</p>
<p>Although Zhou’s other works may serve the purpose of amusement, the idea contained in “The Phonograph Record” is more than entertainment. In the 1920s, the time when “The Phonograph Record” was published, Zhou was the main editor of <em>Free Talk</em>, one of the most influential literary supplements at that time in China. His work was of literary significance.</p>
<p>The idea that it expressed about the meaning of phonograph and voice is long-living. This idea can be found throughout literature in different periods. In <em>300 Tang Poems</em> translated by Xu Yuanchong, thousands of years before, He Zhizhang, a Chinese poet wrote that “I left home young and not till old do I come back. Unchanged my accent, my hair no longer black.” (Xu 57). For He, his voice can show the deep connection between him and his family in his hometown. His accent is his self-identity and a part of himself. For Qin and Lin in Zhou’s Story, the voice in the record can be the way they can communicate with each other even if they’re physically separated by life and death. Even today many works are promoting the idea that voices can represent a person. In the animated movie <em>Violet Evergarden: The Movie</em>, a dying sick boy named Yuris chose to say goodbye to his best friend by telephone because he wanted to be heard at the last moment of his life. Voice is still seen as a way to represent a person. What Zhou express is beyond the era. Sound and voice are always human’s spokesmen that can express our feeling and be a part of us. Although the form of voice can be changed with time, from accent to record and telephone, its meaning stays unchanged for humans.</p>
<p>When the whole society was only promoting the idea of revolution, Zhou’s story served as a reminder that phonographs, or voice, are much more than a tool. In the era when the revolution was promoted in every field, especially literature, there need someone to remind people phonographs and literature not only serve for revolution. Like phonographs are not only machines, literature has its distinctive meaning. Undoubtedly, at that time, the revolution should be the prevalent voice, but people also shouldn’t forget that phonographs and voices are spokesmen for people’s souls. What Zhou wanted to promote is that emotions can be expressed through the phonograph and voice, which have some unique meaning to human beings.</p>

<p>This is the note for the course Advanced Algebra taught by Professor WeiSheng Qiu from Peking University. The noter took the course through recorded video informally. Both the teaching language and the note language is Chinese. </p>
<p>The course started with solving Linear equations. Then, it continues to talk about linear space, including subspace, rank, and other concepts. After that, it covers the calculation of matrices. Then, it begins to talk about another Algebra area about polynomial and rings. After introducing that, the course goes back to linear mapping. After that, bilinear function and normal vector space are introduced. Finally, the quadratic form is covered.</p>
<p>Professor Qiu was very passionate and knowledgeable. During the lectures, he was always trying to tell students more about the mathematical world. His lectures contain many things related to basic knowledge, and he always explained how all the different concepts in algebra are connected with each other. His course developed algebra in a very compact way and introduced the wide applications of algebra.</p>
<p>The cover of the note is Shiina Mashiro from <em>The Pet Girl of Sakurasou</em>. The reason for choosing her picture to be the cover is that she is a genius, and the noter believes only a genius can fully understand this course. The noter finds it extremely hard to understand the relationships between space and the concept of the ring. Besides, the first page of the note is the lyric of <em>Kimi ga Yume wo Tsuretekita (君が夢を連れてきた)</em>, the theme song of <em>The Pet Girl of Sakurasou</em>.</p>
<p>Hope you can like this note.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://imgtu.com/i/O5LcVg"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/05/17/O5LcVg.png" alt="O5LcVg.png"></a></p>
<p>This is the note for the course Analysis taught by Professor Yi Cheng from University of Science and Technology of China. The noter took the course through recorded video informally. Both the teaching language and the note language is Chinese. </p>
<p>The course focused on developing student skills in proving and understanding mathematical concepts. The course goes from Analytic Geometry and then moved on to discuss the Multivariable Calculus. Then, the concepts of curvilinear integrals and surface integrals are discussed. After that, the theme changed to Fourier analysis. Finally, the Gamma function and Beta function are introduced.</p>
<p>In the course, Professor Chen tells the whole story in a clear way. Due to the limitation of time, some proofs are not given. The professor sometimes likes to use examples from physics, which makes the questions become very clear and easy to understand.</p>
<p>The cover of the notebook is Tomori Nao from <em>Charlotte</em>. The reason for choosing her picture to be the cover is that she is always curious and won’t stop until she finds the final answer. Besides, she likes photography very much. The noter thinks that being curious and observant are very helpful when learning analysis. </p>
<p>Hope you will like it.</p>

<h3 id="1-Download-Node-js"><a href="#1-Download-Node-js" class="headerlink" title="1. Download Node.js"></a>1. Download Node.js</h3><h4 id="Windows-users"><a href="#Windows-users" class="headerlink" title="Windows users:"></a>Windows users:</h4><p>You can get Node.js through the official website: <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">https://nodejs.org/en/</a></p>
<p>Remember to download the LTS version. The LTS version is recommended because it has better compatibility.</p>
<p>Simply setting all the things as default values is OK. </p>
<p>If you want to install Node.js to a folder other than suggested, you should keep in mind that you should modify Node.js’s environment.</p>
<p>For Windows users, the following article is recommended to install Node.js: <a href="https://www.cnblogs.com/liuqiyun/p/8133904.html">https://www.cnblogs.com/liuqiyun/p/8133904.html</a></p>
<h4 id="Linux-users"><a href="#Linux-users" class="headerlink" title="Linux users:"></a>Linux users:</h4><p><code>sudo apt-get install nodejs</code></p>
<p><code>sudo apt-get install npm</code></p>
<p>The two commands can do everything for you.</p>
<h4 id="Verification"><a href="#Verification" class="headerlink" title="Verification:"></a>Verification:</h4><p>To verify you have successfully downloaded Node.js, you can open the terminal and text in</p>
<p><code>node -v</code></p>
<p><code>npm -v</code></p>
<p>If a version number is returned, you have successfully installed Node.js. Otherwise, for windows users, you can use the downloaded package to uninstall what you have installed and install again.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/12/1a8cb7b5664fc020.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="2-Download-Git"><a href="#2-Download-Git" class="headerlink" title="2. Download Git"></a>2. Download Git</h3><h4 id="Windows-users-1"><a href="#Windows-users-1" class="headerlink" title="Windows users:"></a>Windows users:</h4><p>You can get Git through the official website: <a href="https://gitforwindows.org/">https://gitforwindows.org/</a></p>
<p>Then do what the instructions ask you to do.</p>
<h4 id="Linux-users-1"><a href="#Linux-users-1" class="headerlink" title="Linux users:"></a>Linux users:</h4><p><code>sudo apt-get install git</code></p>
<p>The command can do everything for you.</p>
<h4 id="Verification-1"><a href="#Verification-1" class="headerlink" title="Verification:"></a>Verification:</h4><p><code>git --version</code></p>
<p>Type the code into the terminal. If the version number of Git is returned, you have successfully installed Git.</p>
<h2 id="3-Install-Hexo"><a href="#3-Install-Hexo" class="headerlink" title="3. Install Hexo"></a>3. Install Hexo</h2><h4 id="Warning-This-part-can-be-extremely-troublesome"><a href="#Warning-This-part-can-be-extremely-troublesome" class="headerlink" title="Warning: This part can be extremely troublesome!"></a>Warning: This part can be extremely troublesome!</h4><p>If you choose to install Node.js in a folder suggested by the install package, congratulations! You have avoided a lot of trouble!</p>
<p>First, you should set up a place for your blog to be stored on your computer. You can create a folder somewhere on your computer.</p>
<p>Then, you should go to the folder in the terminal (using the command cd).</p>
<p>Next, type in the command <code>npm install -g hexo-cli</code></p>
<p>Notice that <code>-g</code> is an alternative parameter, which means installing Hexo globally. And <code>-cli</code> allows you to use command lines to operate Hexo.</p>
<h4 id="Verification-2"><a href="#Verification-2" class="headerlink" title="Verification:"></a>Verification:</h4><p>Type in the code <code>hexo -v</code> in the terminal. If the version number and some other information are returned, you’ve successfully installed Hexo.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/12/315d114f6d094e0b.png" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="Default"><a href="#Default" class="headerlink" title="Default:"></a>Default:</h4><p><code>npm ERR! code EPERM</code><br><code>npm ERR! errno -4048</code></p>
<p>If these kinds of results occurred during your installation, you can find if there are some .npmrc documents generated. Remember, the extra .npmrc should not be what is in your “blog” folder. Instead, try to find these files in <code>C:\Users\YourUserName</code>.</p>
<p>If you do have solved the problems above but still can’t install, it might be that you’re not permitted. To solve it, you can open the WindowsPowerShell in your folder (remember to choose “Run as Administrator” ).</p>
<p>If the two ways cannot solve your problem, you may use the downloaded package to uninstall Node.js and install it again. This actually works even it sounds a bit irrelevant.</p>
<h4 id="Initialize-Hexo"><a href="#Initialize-Hexo" class="headerlink" title="Initialize Hexo"></a>Initialize Hexo</h4><p>Type in the code <code>hexo init</code> in the terminal can initialize your blog. Remember, you should be under the folder of your blog in the terminal when you commit to this command.</p>
<p>Wait for things being downloaded to your folder. If some errors occurred, check if you can connect GitHub. Simply typing in the initializing code again can be helpful.</p>
<h4 id="periodical-achievement"><a href="#periodical-achievement" class="headerlink" title="periodical achievement"></a>periodical achievement</h4><p>To see what you have done after so many steps, you can run <code>hexo s</code> to let your computer act as a server temporarily. </p>
<p><img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/12/228666cc2c61d738.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Type the address “localhost:4000” in a browser and you’ll see your initialized Hexo page.</p>
<p>The initialized page will look like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/12/fe272694b3daa190.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="4-Set-up-a-personal-repository-in-GitHub"><a href="#4-Set-up-a-personal-repository-in-GitHub" class="headerlink" title="4. Set up a personal repository in GitHub"></a>4. Set up a personal repository in GitHub</h3><p>Go to your own GitHub page (if you don’t have an account, just sign up for one and follow the instructions).</p>
<p>Choose the “Repositories” and click the new in green (in the right upper corner in this screenshot).</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/12/c98f49716ba6faf7.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Remember to set the name of the repository as YourGitHubName.github.io. (For example, my GitHub account is Nephrn17, so the repository’s name is Nephren17.github.io) This can help you avoid later troubles.</p>
<h3 id="5-Generate-an-SSH-and-add-it-to-GitHub"><a href="#5-Generate-an-SSH-and-add-it-to-GitHub" class="headerlink" title="5. Generate an SSH and add it to GitHub"></a>5. Generate an SSH and add it to GitHub</h3><p>After creating your own GitHub repository, you should link the repository with the blog on your computer. This is done by adding the SSH to GitHub. Open your blog’s folder, click in with the right button, then git bash here.</p>
<p> First, you should config your account. You can type the code in Git bash like this:</p>
<p><code>git config --global user.name &quot;your GitHub user name&quot;</code></p>
<p><code>git config --global user.email &quot;your GitHub account&#39;s email&quot;</code></p>
<p>After that, you can create your SSH.</p>
<p><code>ssh-keygen -t rsa -C &quot;your GitHub account&#39;s email&quot;</code></p>
<p>In fact, you can type nothing to create an SSH and that’s OK.</p>
<p>After that, a file is created to store the SSH. You can find it in C:\Users\YourUserName\.ssh. There’ll be a file named “id_rsa.pub”. Open the file and copy all the content. (Ctrl+A and Ctrl+C is recommended) Then paste the content to the GitHub page.</p>
<p><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/img_convert/3194ad0a9d04d94c09485122932968f3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The “Title” is not important and you can choose anything you like to name it. Pate what you copied in the “Key”.</p>
<p>To verify if you succeeded, you can type <code>ssh -T git@github.com</code> to test.</p>
<h3 id="6-Deploy-Hexo-to-GitHub"><a href="#6-Deploy-Hexo-to-GitHub" class="headerlink" title="6. Deploy Hexo to  GitHub"></a>6. Deploy Hexo to  GitHub</h3><p>Open the _config.yml file and change it a little bit. (You may need a VSCode to modify it. Some other alternatives are also OK.) You can find what is shown in the picture at the end of this file.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/12/14204663ef6e34a2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Notice that the “repository” should be your repository’s address (Not mine). Other things can</p>
<p> be simply copied.</p>
<p>Then, you need to install deploy-git to enable you to deploy what you have written on your computer to your GitHub </p>
<p>repository. Open the git bash in your blog’s file. The installation is quite simple by typing in a command:</p>
<p><code>npm install hexo-deployer-git --save</code></p>
<p>Then you can see what you have done by typing these commands:</p>
<p><code>hexo g</code></p>
<p><code>hexo d</code></p>
<p>If things go wrong in this step, still, it is probably caused by the network connection problems. You can now visit your website “www.YourGitHubUserName.github.io” and it is your website.</p>
<p>Note:  for <code>hexo g</code>, the “g” stands for “generate”; for <code>hexo d</code>, the “d” stands for “deploy”. For more information about the command lines, you can use the code <code>hexo -h</code> or visit the official website: <a href="https://hexo.io/zh-cn/docs/commands">https://hexo.io/zh-cn/docs/commands</a></p>
<h3 id="7-Issue-Articles"><a href="#7-Issue-Articles" class="headerlink" title="7. Issue Articles"></a>7. Issue Articles</h3><p>To issue an article, you can write in the command line: <code>hexo new &quot;your article&#39;s name&quot;</code> and  YourArticleName.md file will be generated in your “source” folder. You can change the file as you like to be the content of your blog. Then, you still need <code>hexo g</code> and <code>hexo d</code> to deploy it to your GitHub repository.  If nothing is changed, you can simply do that again.</p>
<p>Some websites may suggest you use a <code>hexo clean</code> first. But this command may clear what you written before. So I suggest that if simply two commands are enough to reach your goal, there’s no need to add an extra one.</p>
<p>If you want to see what your article would be like before posting it, similarly, you can use <code>hexo s</code> and visit the local website. Remember, don’t use Ctrl+c to copy as this is meant to stop the program in the Git environment.</p>

<h3 id="8-Other-things-you-can-do-to-make-your-blog-more-interesting"><a href="#8-Other-things-you-can-do-to-make-your-blog-more-interesting" class="headerlink" title="8. Other things you can do to make your blog more interesting"></a>8. Other things you can do to make your blog more interesting</h3><p>To make your blog more interesting, there’re many things that you can do. You can add a lot of plugins and themes to make your blog more attractive.</p>
<p>For plugins, you can visit the official website: <a href="https://hexo.io/plugins/">https://hexo.io/plugins/</a> Actually, we have installed some plugins like hexo-cli and hexo-deployer-git. As all plugins process their own unique function, it’s a wiser choice to explore the world of plugins yourself.</p>
<p>For themes, you can find piles of them also on the official website and GitHub. The official website: <a href="https://hexo.io/themes/">https://hexo.io/themes/</a> The default theme is landscape. To change one, you need to download one first. You can go to chosen theme’s Github page and then clone its address.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/12/164467d891213693.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Click the copy button like what’s on the right side of the picture.  Then type <code>git clone https://github.com/liuyib/hexo-theme-stun.git</code>. (You can choose a different theme by doing what is similar).</p>
<p>The theme this blog is using is called diaspora, and you can find it easily on GitHub.</p>

    <title>Why Fourier&#39;s Series?</title>
    <url>/2022/03/27/Why-Fourier-s-Series/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2022/03/1dbffcb6231fd779.png" alt=""></p>
<p>When learning Fourier’s series, it is usually confusing why we need to learn such a troubling thing? And moreover, why did Fourier come up with this strange idea to represent all functions in a sin and cos way? This is actually an unexpected discovery when the great French mathematician and physicist was dealing with the heat-flow problem in physics.</p>
<p>The problem in physics is about how heat transfers in a pole. Physicists found some patterns of the problem. In mathematics, it can be described as a partial differential equation.</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\begin{cases}
\frac{\partial^2T}{\partial x^2}=k^2 \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} \space\space\space\space (T=T(x,t))\\
T(0,t)=T(l,t)=0\\
T(x,0)=f(x)
\end{cases}</script><p>The function aims at finding out the temperature distribution on a pole. The length of the pole is <em>2l</em>, and at first, the temperature distribution is f(x) (x is the distance from a point to one end of the pole). We want to know how the temperature distribution will be after time t.</p>
<p>The function is a really hard partial differential function, and we cannot solve it directly. When Fourier was dealing with the problem, he tried to separate the variables. He supposed the T can be written as</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
T(x,t) = \phi (x) \psi (t)</script><p>The first line of the function can be written as </p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\phi ''(x)\psi(t)=\phi(x)\psi'(t)</script><p>Then he let</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
-\lambda=\frac{\phi''(x)}{\phi(x)}=\frac{\psi'(t)}{\psi(t)}</script><p>Now the complicated function can be changed into this form:</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\begin{cases}
\phi''(x)+\lambda\phi(x)=0 \space\space\space\space( in \space which\space \phi(0)=\phi(l)=0)\\
\psi'(t)+\lambda\psi(t)=0
\end{cases}</script><p>This is a much easy form! The unsolvable partial differential equation is suddenly turned into such an easy question!</p>
<p>To solve function in line first:</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\phi(x)=b\space sin(\sqrt\lambda +c)</script><p>As</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\phi(0)=\phi(l)=0</script><p>We can deduce that</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
sin\space c=0, \space\space\space so\space c=0</script><p>As</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
sin(\sqrt\lambda l)=0,\space\space\space so \space \sqrt\lambda l=n\pi</script><p>We can note</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\phi_n(x)=b_n sin(\frac{n\pi}{l})</script><p>The corresponding lambda can be written as</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\lambda_n=(\frac{n\pi}{l})^2</script><p>Then we continue to solve the function in the second line:</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\psi(t)=e^{-\lambda t}=e^{-(\frac{n\pi}{l})^2t}</script><p>Finally, the solution to the heat-flow problem can be represented as</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
T_n(x,t)=\phi(x)\psi(t)=e^{-(\frac{n\pi}{l})^2t}sin(\frac{n\pi}{l}x)</script><p>For the more common conditions of the problem, the solution is the linear combination of all these Tns:</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
T(x,t)=\sum^\infin_{n=0}b_ne^{(\frac{n\pi}{l})^2t}sin(\frac{n\pi}{l}x)</script><p>Then, we need to find the case which fits the t=0 case. We can notice that</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
f(x)=\sum^\infin_{n=0}b_ne^{(\frac{n\pi}{l})^2t}sin(\frac{n\pi}{l}x)</script><p>This is not so common! f(x) is not something special, but a function is previously decided! However, it can be represented by an infinite number of sin and cos functions adding up! Fourier noticed there must be some deeper things under the mathematic form. Tn of course is the solution (this can be verified by putting Tn back to the partial differential function), and in the real physical world, the heat also transfer. Fourier noticed there must be some deeper things under the mathematic form. So this means most functions can be represented in this way!</p>
<p>So the questions are raised:</p>
<p>What kind of functions can be represented as the sum of a lot of sin and cos functions?</p>
<p>Can the sum converge? Where will it converge?</p>
<p>If it can converge to f(x), how to decide the coefficient for each sin and cos function?</p>

    <title>The View from a WWF Poster: Who Should be Responsible and What’s the Solution to Environmental Problems?</title>
    <url>/2021/12/25/The-View-from-a-WWF-Poster-Who-Should-be-Responsible-and-What%E2%80%99s-the-Solution-to-Environmental-Problems/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p> Nowadays, environmental problems are gaining increasing attention globally. Forests are disappearing, animals are being killed and oceans are being polluted. This is also what is portrayed in a WWF poster. A huge offshore drilling platform is drawn in the center, killing a lot of fish under it. At the bottom, there’s an anchorage saying “our hunger for fossil fuels is destroying the oceans”. The poster shows the cruelty of ocean pollution caused by exploiting fossil fuels through visual art. In fact, the underlying opinion of the poster is all people who benefit from modern fossil technologies should be responsible for pollution, and it tries to motivate people to take action by raising viewers’ negative emotions. (Below is the poster made by WWF.)</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/12/167da8bd96972d0b.jpg" alt="The poster made by WWF"></p>
<p>When it comes to who should be responsible for pollution, the problem is long been argued. Among all opinions, two provided by Crutzen and Malm can be very representative. They both agreed that our nature is disturbed by humans, and we humans should take responsibility. However, Crutzen reckons that all human beings are responsible and we should develop science and technology to address the environmental and energy issues. (Crutzen,2) In <em>Geology of Mankind</em>, he listed a set of examples to show the climate and atmosphere is has been changed greatly by humans since the industrial revolution. (Crutzen,1) The whole nature comes into an era of Anthropocene, where the power of humans is not neglectable. (Crutzen,2) So technological methods are needed when trying to solve the problem as it’s caused by technology development. (Crutzen,1)</p>
<p>On the other hand, Malm denies the claim all human being responsible. Instead of Anthropocene, Malm coined “Capitalocene” in <em>The view from Dominica: Anthropocene or Capitalocene</em> to show that it is capitalists, instead of all human beings, should be responsible. (Malm,3) He claims that capitalists are those who gain profit from fossil fuels in nature, so environmental problems are their fault. (Malm,4) However, those who are irrelevant to nature-disturbing behaviors are getting into trouble. For example, people in Dominica, a country where “most people subsisted on small-scale farming”, can be trapped in hurricanes caused by the warming climate. (Malm,2) But they are innocent as they produce no greenhouse gases and no pollution. (Malm,2) It is the capitalists that should be punished. (Malm,4) So Malm proposed that governments and international institutes should limit capitalists’ exploiting behavior through laws and other political ways. (Malm,4)</p>
<p>The poster holds an opinion that is between the two, blaming all people who benefit from fossil fuels. When it comes to who should be responsible, the poster stands closer to Crutzen, as most people benefit from nature-disturbing technologies. And the opinion proposed in the poster doesn’t conflict with Malm’s argument with Crutzen, as people who live in a way “without modern” like Dominicans are excluded. But when it comes to solutions, the poster may rely more on appealing to people instead of technology methods proposed by Crutzen. All these opinions are hidden behind the art expression of the poster.</p>
<p>Various methods in visual art are used in the poster to raise people’s negative emotions and to motivate them to take measures. Only four keys appeared (black, white, dull-red, and blue), making them more impressive, thus making readers feel shocked by what is portrayed. Only black and white is used in the center to draw the drilling platform and dead fishes. The background is dull-red, which is the color of coagulated blood. Covering the whole background, the key shocks viewers by implying a large number of killed fish through visual art. In particular, fishes are all black, which can have two implications: first, the fish is no longer living. Second, the fish died of petrol, (which is also black), that leaked and polluted the ocean. The whole scene gives viewers a strong sense of lifelessness. As humans, more general, as living things, all the people prefer a world with lives instead of only inorganic matter. Also, death, no matter human’s or other living things, can lead to sympathy. That’s because the deep-lying value of all the living things is created equal. In this sense, viewers who haven’t noticed the link between petrol use and themselves can be sympathetic, and those who discovered they are to be blamed can be regretful to their energy-wasting behaviors.</p>
<p>Besides, the sharp contrast of the shape of the fishes and the platform can further develop viewers’ emotions. The sympathetic response for the fish could lead to anger towards petrol companies, whereas the regret response could lead to guilty feelings and repent of so much petrol. The platform is drawn more in rectangles, and fishes are drawn more in curves. Though it’s only a simple fact that the surfaces of living things are smoother compared to machines, this is meaningful in the poster. The curve of the fish reminds viewers of the fishes once lived. They have smooth body shapes but were now completely black and dead. Viewers shocked by the lifelessness can be either angry, wanting to find out the criminal, or guilty, feeling regret and sorry for the ocean creatures for their fossil use.</p>
<p>The two different reactions created by the key and shape can finally be united and converted into guilt and shame by the anchorage at the bottom. The anchorage below the painting “our hunger for fossil fuels is destroying the ocean” clearly shows the attitude of the author: we, humans benefit from using fossil fuels, should be responsible for the death of the fishes and we should use fewer fuels to avoid destroying the ocean. Those who previously consider petrol companies being responsible are forced to realize they are the customer, the final master of all the cruel machines. All viewers are forced to reflect on their daily petrol use. The use of “our” robbed viewers of all excuses, directly converting all the shock, sympathy, regret, and anger accumulated by the keys outline into guilty. The strong emotion can push people to change their behaviors thus reaching the purpose of entreating them to save energy.</p>
<p>All the use of keys, shapes, and anchorage serves the hiding opinion, that all modern people are responsible. In this paper, “modern people” refers to people enjoying the benefit of industrialization and modernization, especially the benefit of using fossil fuels and plastic products. The fact that the poster hopes viewers to feel guilty must be set on the viewers having used fossil fuels. After all, how can you expect a man who never uses petrol to save petrol? This can also be seen as the poster is an online poster, which means mainly modern people can have access to it. All these imply that, when it comes to who should be responsible, the poster stands closer to Crutzen, but it excludes people living outside the modern world. Nevertheless, the poster doesn’t pursue a technical solution, but rather a managing one like Malm. Instead of relying on science’s development, the poster tries to solve environmental problems through appealing and regulating. The difference between the poster and Malm is that Malm asks the government to manage a small number of capitalists forcefully, but the poster entreats all people to save the environment.</p>
<p>To be more essential, the form of the poster and the poster’s creator, WWF, decides its opinion, which puts all modern people guilty. The purpose of a poster is to appeal to more people, so it cannot only aim at a small number of people, like capitalists. What it is expected to do is be shown to a large number of modern people, then generating huge effect by letting every people does a little. Besides the art form, the organization behind it is also related. As a non-governmental organization, what WWF can do is limited. It doesn’t have the ability to develop technology like what Crutzen says, neither can it limit the actions of capitalists like Malm says. But it actually can change others’ behavior through appealing in a rather emotional way. By putting every modern people be responsible, these people can be motivated and help save the environment. That’s why the poster won’t accuse capitalists in a Malm way, but use the managing method differently. In other words, finding out who is to blame is not the core mission of the poster and WWF. Choosing to support this opinion is only because, for this specific poster, this is the best opinion that can inspire people to take action to save our nature.</p>
<p>However, the stereotype in the poster can decrease the poster’s credit and effect. Objectively speaking, petrol isn’t always a pollution-causer, sometimes, it can reduce pollution in some circumstances. According to <em>The Two Worlds in the Anthropocene: A New Approach for Managing and Coping with Climate Change,</em> a speech given by Veerabhadran Ramanathan, the most serious problem is not caused by petrol but firewood. He found that “160 million homes along India’s Indo-Gangetic plains alone burn firewood from the forests just to meet basic needs”. (Veerabhadran,2) That’s really a way of low-efficiency and can cause more pollution. (Veerabhadran,2) According to his estimation, that cleaner alternative like petrol be provided to these people “can slow down warming by 50% by 2050”. (Veerabhadran,8) What Veerabhadran proposed can be a strong opposer to Malm and the poster’s view. It shows in some cases, capitalism and modernism can help save the environment. On this point, using less sea petrol is not more emergency than making it possible for a huge number of people gaining the access to cleaner fossil fuels. (Veerabhadran,10) This point can make the claim of the poster being partial, as maybe the use of fuel may save some animals by avoiding wood from being cut and burned. Although this can decrease the credit of the poster, what the poster proposed is not all wrong. After all, saving energy is no-fault. (Below is the effect of reducing burning firewood suggested by Veerabhadran)</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/12/e4e92c13d0bb2780.png" alt="The effect of reducing burning firewood suggested by Veerabhadran" style="zoom: 67%;" /></p>
<p>Maybe some people may consider that, instead of all modern people, the poster aims only at those whose work is related to petrol. This may make sense because they think the majority don’t think they are related to the remote offshore drilling platform. However, although many haven’t seen the platform, they do know the machine is used to produce fossil fuels, and this can remind them of their daily fuel use. Besides, even those whose work is related to fossils, who were considered the target of the poster, probably won’t feel guilty after seeing the poster. That’s because it’s not them, at least not only them use petrol fuel. Moreover, as a poster, the author of it must hope more people can be influenced, instead of just the fossil-industry-related. So the opinion that the poster aims at people in petrol-related fields is not so persuasive than it targets all modern people. </p>
<p>By way of conclusion, the poster uses different ways to raise the sympathy and guilty of viewers to motivate modern people to use less fossil fuel. The poster, also WWF, doesn’t care who is truly responsible, but they want to influence people emotionally and motivate them into actions. Crutzen, Malm, and WWF work for the same purpose——saving our Earth. Although the painting may cover some facts and neglect other reasons causing ocean pollution, which is reverse its purpose, it does appeal to modern people to do their bit and has a good effect.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<h3 id="PART-1-个体生命与整体"><a href="#PART-1-个体生命与整体" class="headerlink" title="PART 1   个体生命与整体"></a>PART 1   个体生命与整体</h3><blockquote>
<p>但是太阳，它每时每刻都是夕阳也都是旭日。当它熄灭着走下山去收尽苍凉残照之际，正是它在另一面燃烧着爬上山巅布散烈烈朝辉之时。那一天，我也将沉静着走下山去，扶着我的拐杖。有一天，在某一处山洼里，势必会跑上来一个欢蹦的孩子，抱着他的玩具。</p>
<p>当然，那不是我。</p>
<p>但是，那不是我吗？</p>
<p>——《我与地坛》</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2022/03/c276cb7339729371.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>上述是史铁生《我与地坛》中部分的引用。我们看到了，当我们把视角从人的个体拓展到人类的群体，人便不在那么容易消亡。当我们把自己看作一个整体，看作是人类的一部分，那么，死亡便如同是一个必经的过程。如果我们更进一步，把人的境界从冯友兰说的“圣人境界”提升到了“天地境界”，成为了孟子所说的“天民”，那么个体的消失只是宇宙的一个变化中的一个部分。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>死不是生的对立面，而是为作为生的一部分永存  </p>
<p>——村上春树</p>

<p>“生命犹如水逝，而逝水终在海；死去犹如月落，落月不离天”。当把人类的个体放在整体当中，“人类的咆哮可以压过方寸间的忧虑”。整体的永存让 “生而必死，劳而无功”的悲观的生命增添了一丝亮色。如史铁生在《我与地坛》的结尾所说的，“宇宙以其不息的欲望将一个歌舞炼为永恒。这欲望有怎样一个人间的姓名，大可忽略不计。” </p>
<h3 id="PART-2-永恒轮回说"><a href="#PART-2-永恒轮回说" class="headerlink" title="PART 2 永恒轮回说"></a>PART 2 永恒轮回说</h3><p>不过，这样融入整体就真的好吗？如同在来自第39号浮游岛上〈沉滞的第十一兽〉，其本质就是人的执念。兽象征着人死亡的方式，而当人被简单的执念束缚在一起时，看似人组成了强大的不会死亡的整体，这也同样意味着人的个体个性的抹杀和消除。</p>
<p>这生活，如同你现在经历和曾经经历的，你必将再一次和无数次经历它；其中没有任何新东西，而是每种痛苦，每种快乐，每种思想，每种叹息，生活中一切极小和极大的事，都按照相同的排列和顺序。生存的永恒沙漏将不断地旋转——而你这微尘与它向伴随！</p>
<p>如果人不是作为一种在某一个特定的时间和空间范围存在的人，而是作为整体的人，那尼采认为，人的一切东西都会循环往复的反复进行。虽然有人评价这样的永恒循环说是一种宗教式的，极端个人的想法，但是笔者私下里认为，也是可以为这样的理论找到些许的科学依据。如果我们基于三个基本假设：</p>
<p>1.宇宙中的微观状态数是有限的</p>
<p>2.如果宇宙的时间是无限的（即宇宙不会消亡）</p>
<p>3.从一个微观状态到下一个微观状态是有规律的</p>
<p><img src="https://nimg.ws.126.net/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fspider.ws.126.net%2F54d6941e5e5cdd073c6a331dafc1e12a.jpeg&amp;thumbnail=650x2147483647&amp;quality=80&amp;type=jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>这里解释一下为什么需要上述的三个基本假设。首先，第一个基本假设是处于宇宙的总质量（或者说总能量）不会有改变。这是基于能量守恒定律（该定律可以被转化为空间对称性，但是我们无法验证空间是否对称）。其次，提出第二个基本假设是因为，我们之前为了缓解个体生命的消逝，提出了因为个体生命可以给人类整体做出贡献，但是如果人类，宇宙整体无法得到永恒，那么宇宙整体也是无意义的，反退回个体也就没有意义了。第三个基本假设来自于，所有的科学基本都认为，事物发展存在某一种规律。该假设就是说从一个时间点到下一个时间点之间，世界的两种状态不是随机出现的，下一个状态由上一个状态决定。也就是说，如果给你十个数，让你去往下写，1之后只能跟2，2之后只能跟3……，这样很快就会出现循环。宇宙只不过是多一些的微观状态，但是终归会出现循环。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>世界是一种流转易形，而总量不变的力，置于一定的空间中，因而其组合不可避免地具有重复性。  ——尼采 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>由此观之，人的生命历程感觉就是被定在了墙上，所有的一切都是安排好的，没有什么新的东西。人只能消极的，无意义的接受这样的生命，要接受生命无意义这样的悲观现实。</p>
<h3 id="PART-3-终于来到了关于星神（Visitors）的传说"><a href="#PART-3-终于来到了关于星神（Visitors）的传说" class="headerlink" title="PART 3 终于来到了关于星神（Visitors）的传说"></a>PART 3 终于来到了关于星神（Visitors）的传说</h3><p>在《末日时在做什么？有没有空？可以来拯救吗？》的轻小说中，星神（Visitors）是从别的世界而来，创造了这个世界的人。他们对于当前的世界而言可以看作是像凉宫春日一样的本体。世界是由于他们的幻想而存在的，因此，如果说世界是永恒的，那么星神就是永恒的。在这样的背景下，人们为了获得星神的碎片而杀死了星神。但是人类最后灭亡了。而星神的碎片化为了妖精。所谓的妖精，对于星神而言就是一个个梦境。妖精在战斗中固然个体会消失，但是当梦醒来的时候，“无论喜悦，悲伤，还是喜欢某个人的感情，都会残存一点点”，因此妖精的生命意义可以通过星神得以呈现。可以看出，如果应用PART1中的理论，星神的存在让妖精的生命获得测了意义。</p>
<p>但是绕不开的还有PART2。妖精，也就是星神的梦境，会反复而类似的出现。这也就是艾露可看到一个不一样的梦境——珂朵莉时如此高兴的原因。但是，所有的妖精有着共同的本性，这也导致了艾瑟雅的人格原来来自于纳莎妮亚·维尔·帕捷姆（采用萌娘百科的人名）的原因。星神的碎片是有限的，因此妖精的人格也是有限的。这也就是在星神确定的世界中无可避免的无限循环。</p>
<p><img src="https://image.32yx.com/file/userfiles/images/2017082810344078256.png" alt=""></p>
<p>对于神话，其价值之一就是可以在现实世界中找到神话的后续或者是映射。例如，虽然个体的人是不一样的，但是人的特征是一样的。人的性格可以是一样的。这里指的性格指的是单一性格，例如开朗，乐观，傲娇等。一个性格可以有不同的表征，但是其本质是一样的。人的人格，这里看作不同性格的总和，虽然彼此不同，但是组成成分是一样的。这就好像微分方程接出来的解，通过线性组合可以得到无数种解，但是本质上的特解就那么几种。人的性格无非就那么几种，人格也就是那么几种组成。</p>
<p>按照《可塑性记忆》中所说的，人是由记忆和人格组成的。如果说人格是有限的，或者说有限组合出的，那么人与人不同之处就只是记忆了。但是，当人面对世界的时候，处理模式往往也是由于人格决定的。这也就意味着用于组成记忆的这些事件，本质上也是由于人格主导的。这就代表着人也就是这点东西，毕竟，“太阳底下无新鲜事”。</p>
<h3 id="PART-4-回到了对于意义的探寻"><a href="#PART-4-回到了对于意义的探寻" class="headerlink" title="PART 4 回到了对于意义的探寻"></a>PART 4 回到了对于意义的探寻</h3><p>好了，传统的价值都消解了，准备开始一切价值重估。《末日时在做什么？有没有空？可以来拯救吗？》中，珂朵莉并没有觉得自己是不幸的，相反，她是世界上最幸福的女孩。这是因为，她的幸福不是来自己的永恒，而是来自于自己的消解。在故事的最后，最后的最后，諾夫特·K·迪斯佩拉提奧都不能理解珂朵莉。那是因为，诺夫特把幸福看作是一种得到的过程，而事实上，幸福在很多情况下是一种主动的给予，一种自我消解和自我湮灭。这并不意味着人可以得到永恒，而是人的一种“无问西东”的心理状态。幸福和人上意义本质上可以看作是同质的，也就不做那么多没有必要的区分了。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>你啊，是让我见识到许许多多第一次的人。在白铁摊贩街，你第一次救了我。视野辽阔的高塔，是你第一次带我过去的。你第一次让我见到了许多表情。你更是第一次让我依赖的人、第一次想帮助我的人、第一次帮了我的人、第一次让我输的人，哎哟，要数根本数不完。<br>所以，当然喽。喜欢的人是你。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>人的价值并不是在于永恒，而是在于当下。如珂朵莉·諾塔·瑟尼歐里斯所说的，“与其站在原地思考，不如一步一步地往前走吧，就算昨天的足迹会消失不见，哪怕通往明天的道路隐没在黑暗中，即便如此……也不要一味地回首过去，不要对未来悲观失望，只需尽情地感受当下。因为不管你如何反抗，时间总是会不断推着你前进。”之所以会产生喜欢的因素，是因为这是对于个体而言的，对于单独的梦境而言，第一次就是第一次，不会因为什么循环或者乱七八糟的东西而对于个体产生影响。</p>
<p>同样的，从这样来看，最后珂朵莉选择自我消解也就是可以理解的了。这个是单独的梦境，梦境中人应该做的是不让这个梦境变得遗憾。即使它是悲伤的，是痛苦的，但是只要她是无悔的，那么这就是一场好梦。“梦总是会醒来的，所以梦大桥哦了最后总是那么悲伤。”但是不止是这样，悲伤并没有结束。就算梦醒之后什么都不记得了，梦本身也是美好的，是流光溢彩的。</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2022/03/daf5a2c8f5048407.png" alt=""></p>
<p>个人的意义应该在自己的世界里面追求，而不应该考虑通过整体获得意义。通过整体，最后只能是在整体消亡过后个体意义也随之消失。但是，对于个体，我们要做的是接受和拥抱毁灭，而不是找个什么永恒的东西否定毁灭。如《地狱变》中描述的，毁灭也可以是美丽的。珂朵莉进了自己的努力，这就可以了，她无论做什么，都是因为她获得了足够的幸福。作为幸福这样一种纯粹主管的体验，是不需要一个“永恒”的帽子的。</p>
<p>爱你所爱，行你所行。听从你心，无问西东。</p>
<h3 id="PART-5-关于諾夫特（后记）"><a href="#PART-5-关于諾夫特（后记）" class="headerlink" title="PART 5 关于諾夫特（后记）"></a>PART 5 关于諾夫特（后记）</h3><p>获得幸福的人，获得人生意义的人，其实威笔都是那些能想清楚的人。不过，世界本身就不完全是用来想清楚的。很多时候，是那些顽固不化的人最终获得了幸福和意义。某种程度上，珂朵莉和威廉都是这样的人。所以，或许諾夫特也可以获得幸福吧。</p>

    <title>繁花似锦的幻想乡：虚幻对现实的慰藉 ——《荷塘月色》和《银河铁道之夜》的对比阅读</title>
    <url>/2022/02/22/%E7%B9%81%E8%8A%B1%E4%BC%BC%E9%94%A6%E7%9A%84%E5%B9%BB%E6%83%B3%E4%B9%A1/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>现实生活常有不如意，甚至是痛苦的事情。佛家言“生老病死”皆是苦难，总有过不去的坎，走不动的路。我们不可能相信所有的人都能所有人都能像西西弗斯一样推动巨石，像圣地亚哥一样挑战大海，像赫克托尔一样向命运之神挑战。再进一步，甚至这些人也不是英雄，如尼采所言，“我寻求伟人,但我发现的始终仅仅是伟人理想的猴子。”，即使是塑造出的英雄，也只是有着英雄理想的凡人罢了。面对这样的现实，幻想看似只是一纸空。但是，幻想乡同样反映着人们的精神家园和理想追求。幻想中的世界既是对于现实世界的抚慰，也是人类对于善和美极致的追求。</p>
<p><img src="http://mms2.baidu.com/it/u=1683847685,3116345340&amp;fm=253&amp;app=138&amp;f=JPG&amp;fmt=auto&amp;q=75?w=800&amp;h=450" alt=""></p>
<p>在《幻想万华镜——花之异变之章》中曾提到，幻想乡中漫山遍野的花长日盛开，是因为外界发生了战争，瘟疫，让大量的生命消逝，化作了幻想乡中的春日胜景。笔者认为，不仅仅是生命的消逝，所有的悲伤和痛苦，都让人愈发向往美好，因此也就构件中了人心中的幻想乡。在让人痛苦的现实面前，幻想的可以提供让人心灵宁静的殿堂。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>将向悲伤与痛苦，化作光芒     —— 天野远子</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="关于银河铁道之夜"><a href="#关于银河铁道之夜" class="headerlink" title="关于银河铁道之夜"></a>关于银河铁道之夜</h3><p>这个故事的创作背景是一个困苦的年代。宫泽贤治的国家先后参加了战争为了满足军需，政府对内横征暴敛，资本家、地主趁机残酷剥削和压榨人民。世界经济危机给社会经济造成空前打击，工人失业，工厂倒闭，罢工浪潮此起彼伏。宫泽贤治的故乡更是雪上加霜，常年受干旱、低温、暴雨、暴风雪等自然灾害影响，农作物歉收，学生担负不起学费中途退学者增加，贩卖女儿家离子散的悲剧相继出现。</p>
<p>在这样的时代背景下，1922年，宫泽贤治的妹妹敏子去世。当时作者的处境并不乐观，作品并不是很为人们所接受，很多时候，作品的读者只有自己的妹妹。这让作者悲痛欲绝，而这种痛失亲人的感觉让作家产生了一种想表达人类面对苦难时想拯救自我、拯救他人以及获得解脱的主题的愿望。</p>
<p><img src="http://mms2.baidu.com/it/u=2977169039,2783416668&amp;fm=253&amp;app=138&amp;f=JPEG&amp;fmt=auto&amp;q=75?w=580&amp;h=435" alt=""></p>
<p>在这样的背景中，作者幻想出了一个架空的，无比美丽绚烂的，有令人悲伤的故事。故事的主人公，一个名叫乔邦尼的男孩，有一天在山丘上睡着了。在睡梦中，他搭上了一趟开往天国的银河铁道列车，和班上他最好的朋友柯贝瑞拉作者铁道列车在银河中遨游。天空中对策一个个星座，就是他们的一个个车站。他们在车上遇到了各式各样的人。但是在某一站，柯贝瑞拉突然离开了乔邦尼独自下车了。当乔邦尼作者列车继续前进，到他醒来，发现这不过是一个梦。但当他跑下山丘回家时，却听到了一个几乎让他不敢相信的消息：康贝瑞拉在河里淹死了。</p>
<p>这部作品是童话，它构建了一个无比美丽的银河世界。在小说的开头，“焦班尼朝那儿望去，只见莹白、雪亮的银河河岸上，银空中的一片芒草，随风摇曳，掀起一片片波浪。”乔邦尼是欣喜的，雀跃的，看到了如此美丽的景致。“咣当咣当，那列漂亮的小火车随着天空的芒草波浪飘荡，在天河流水中，在三角点的银光里，勇往直前地行进。”</p>
<p>随着旅程不断进行，乔邦尼和柯贝瑞拉遇到了不少乘客，他们上了车，又下了车。每一个人都是不期而遇，但是此生只能遇到一次的人。即使是看似有些鲁莽，被彼岸世界拒绝了的“捕鸟人”，或许是一个士兵，又或许是普通人，他也是一个善良美好的人。但是，在这样美好的景色中，又莫名又几分忧愁。“  河对岸的远方，可以隐约望见点点烟雾和星星之火。那火光既宁静又凄凉，望着它可平复自己的心潮。”在这样如画的星空当中，火光也显出了寂静，凄清和寒冷。这也预示着后来小说的情感走向。</p>
<p>“啊，为什么没有人跟随自己走向那遥远的地方？柯贝内拉正跟那个女孩子情投意合地交谈呢！这实在令人难以忍受。” 此时的乔邦尼害怕孤独，害怕别离。在一次次的别离中，他看到的是美好消逝的痛苦。但是，仍是不得不别离，“柯贝内拉，我们一起去，好吗？焦班尼说着回过头来，可刚才还有柯贝内拉坐着的座位上，已不见他的影子。只有黑天鹅绒座椅，闪闪发光。”这是没有办法的，是只能接受的。”然而，生活本来如此——任何人都无法替代别人。这就像列车上来来往往的旅客样，每个人都有自己到达站点，因此，我们既不可能和别人分享过去，一也不可能和别人同向未来。“一梦醒来，乔邦尼就听闻了柯贝瑞拉落水身亡的事情，故事到这里就结束了。</p>
<p>但这个故事不只是一个童话。故事并没有结局，小说家并没有告诉我们乔邦尼最后是怎么想的，以及他的心情究竟如何。在这样一个故事中，宫泽贤治希望通过营造一个完美的星空和幻想世界来消除内心的悲伤，劝说自己接受妹妹去世的事实。即使在如此静谧甜美的环境中，从字里行间，掩藏不住的是内心的寂寞和感伤。作品中主人公的孤独，与作者的孤独是一致的。“光阴者，百代之过客”，这个道理上是懂的，苏斯博士说的“不应因结束而伤感，而应因存在过而欣喜”，这个道理也是懂的，但是，人的匆匆离别仍然是痛苦的，留下的人仍然是寂寞的，这不是道理可以解决的问题。相比于这样的道理，幻想世界又体现出了悲伤之外的东西，尽管美丽的景物很悲伤，但是悲伤亦彰显了事物的美丽。人生的生离死别是无奈的，我们只能把这样的悲伤诗化，用不存在的东西安抚真实世界的心灵。</p>
<p><img src="http://mms2.baidu.com/it/u=1326011595,929173621&amp;fm=253&amp;app=120&amp;f=JPEG&amp;fmt=auto&amp;q=75?w=1344&amp;h=800" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="关于《荷塘月色》"><a href="#关于《荷塘月色》" class="headerlink" title="关于《荷塘月色》"></a>关于《荷塘月色》</h3><p>“没有月光的晚上，这路上阴森森的，有些怕人。今晚却很好，虽然月光也还是淡淡的。”这反映的是朱自清教授烦躁的内心世界。 1927年7月，白色恐怖笼罩中国。在这样的背景中，朱自清作为一个自由主义者，在清华也和宫泽贤治一样不被人接受，遭遇着各种不顺。本质上来讲，朱自清是一个“狷者”，出生于扬州，他的性格本就不喜争斗，即使把字改为“佩弦”，也不会改变本性中和蔼的成分。如叶兆言评价的，“闻一多是嫉恶如仇，而朱自清是从善如流。”但是在当时，朱自清即不愿意做别人的发言人，又没有自我表达的空间，所以他只能陷入失语的状态。他是诗人，却不再作诗；他是散文家，却不再写作散文，整是整理国故，消磨光阴。现实世界在精神上的困顿，让作者醉心于荷塘月色之中。</p>
<p><img src="http://mms0.baidu.com/it/u=3373708799,3645536567&amp;fm=253&amp;app=138&amp;f=JPEG&amp;fmt=auto&amp;q=75?w=640&amp;h=359" alt=""></p>
<p>“曲曲折折的荷塘上面，弥望的是田田的叶子。叶子出水很高，像亭亭的舞女的裙。层层的叶子中间，零星地点缀着些白花，有袅娜地开着的，有羞涩地打着朵儿的；正如一粒粒的明珠，又如碧天里的星星，又如刚出浴的美人。”有人说朱自清用的是工笔，确实，这种工笔中流露的是作者想要营造的，不存在于现实世界的精神的荷塘。正是因为心中不宁静，因此才觉得小路宁静，才需要一个精神的荷塘。但是在这种美景当中，作者仍然有着自己心情抑制不住的流露，“这时候最热闹的，要数树上的蝉声与水里的蛙声；但热闹是它们的，我什么也没有。”</p>
<p>当作者写道“忽然想起采莲的事情来了。采莲是江南的旧俗，似乎很早就有，而六朝时为盛；从诗歌里可以约略知道。采莲的是少年的女子，她们是荡着小船，唱着艳歌去的。采莲人不用说很多，还有看采莲的人。那是一个热闹的季节，也是一个风流的季节。”物质的荷塘以及该变成了精神性质的，可以脱离整个痛苦的时代，而存在于久远的时空当中。这就是作者追求心灵上的安静而营造出的幻想乡，为了逃离现实世界，给自己的心一个可以安适的家园。</p>
<h3 id="繁花似锦的幻想乡"><a href="#繁花似锦的幻想乡" class="headerlink" title="繁花似锦的幻想乡"></a>繁花似锦的幻想乡</h3><p>对于内心的悲伤，战胜和克服并不是唯一的解决方式。或许，放任不管，或者是逃避也是不可避免地。“逃避固然可耻但是有用”，或许这么说有些不负责任，但是，幻想的世界有其价值。百目怪听闻赫克托尔的笛声愿意闭上所有的眼睛，也是因为被幻想乡的美景所吸引而陶醉了吧。幻想的世界并没有完全回避悲伤和痛苦，而是通过美好的表达，让我们变得可以正视这些情感。在这些幻想的世界中，如师陀在《说书人》中说的，“一切曾使我们欢喜和曾使我们苦痛的全过去了，全随了岁月暗淡了，终至于消灭了；只有那些被吹嘘和根本不曾存在过的人物，等到我们稍微安闲下来，便在我们昏暗的记忆中出现，永远顶生动顶有光辉。”幻想乡是人类的精神家园。</p>
<p>美轮美奂的诗歌背后是对苦难的清晰认识。幻想家不是在逃避生活，而是试图重新认识生活。死亡本是丑陋的，不幸的，而宫泽贤治却将其描述为“如星辰般消散”；孤独本是痛苦的，而朱自清却看到了清风明月荷花。他们不是在寻求慰藉，而是背负着命运的重担在寻找诗意的出路。最崇高的幻象必然以最深刻的苦痛为底色。尼采认为，“（英雄）要在自己身上克服这个时代。”幻想家正是这样的英雄。</p>
<p>希望，在现实的不如意面前，我们可以有逃离现实的精神家园。希望这样的幻想，让这漫长痛苦的现实，在最后一瞬间也能变成了一个充满纯洁、温柔光芒的祝福的故事。</p>
