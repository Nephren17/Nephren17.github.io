        <div class="content markdown">
            <p>​    Nowadays, we are very familiar with the concept of adaptation: films adapted from novels, TV series adapted from comics, and so on. Among them, the adaption from comic to animation is quite prevalent. If we consider animation as art, what’s the relationship between it and the original comic? From neo-formalism, we know “the form of an art and the importance of representational content” should also be equally emphasized (Carroll, 130). What happens when an adapted version represents the theme of the original one? As formalism cares about how art is represented as form, can there be a better one?</p>
<p>​    If both can be viewed as art, the original comic and the adapted animation should both show the theme, which may be the aboutness in the formalism theory, very well with different forms and advantages (Carroll, 27). Animation and the comic shouldn’t be compared and can both perform very well in showing the theme even in different visual and presentational methods. </p>
<p>​    We can examine the principle with <em>Hayate the Combat Butler</em>, an animation and a comic that shares the same name, and see how it works. The comic and the animation tell about the amusing daily life of Nagi Sanzenin and her butler, Hayate Ayasaki. The comic and the animation are both quite popular, as the comic had serialized for thirteen years (a very long time for a comic) and the animation includes four seasons and about 100 episodes (which is also an unusual length for animation). The long duration of time can show its great popularity. As commented by Allen Moody, “I got several good laughs out of every episode in Season One, and almost every episode in Season Two.” (Moody). The comic and animation’s purpose concerns the interesting things in daily life. So how can comics and animation be successful and unique with the same theme?</p>
<p>​    The animation adapts the comic while adding new features. The comic emphasized every moment, which means the character’s expression and behavior at a certain moment are recorded. The style of drawing can be extremely exaggerated, expressing the idea well.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgtg.com/image/mwsrC"><img src="https://i.imgtg.com/2022/10/04/mwsrC.png" alt="mwsrC.png"></a></p>
<p>Nagi’s (right) shocking expression (<em>Hayate the Combat Butler</em> Vol.328, 20)</p>
<p>​    For example, the image is aimed at showing the thickness of Nagi, whose face has been almost filled with her mouth. We can also notice Nagi’s body is out of proportion with her head, which also helps show her surprise.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgtg.com/image/mwVQL"><img src="https://i.imgtg.com/2022/10/04/mwVQL.png" alt="mwVQL.png"></a></p>
<p>Nagi’s expression in the context (<em>Hayate the Combat Butler</em> Vol.328, 20)</p>
<p>​    Besides the tricks mentioned above, when being put into the context, a certain image can be emphasized through typesetting. In this example, Nagi’s expression takes the place of two images, making her more eye-catching.</p>
<p>​    The comic specializes in dealing with every scene, trying to make every character expressive and present their characters and features. All the scenes and characters from everyday life and all constitute what wanted to be expressed: the common everyday life itself is already interesting enough.</p>
<p>​    On the other hand, the adapted animation does use similar expressions to make some scenes expressive.</p>
<p>   <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgtg.com/image/mwYCi"><img src="https://i.imgtg.com/2022/10/04/mwYCi.png" alt="mwYCi.png"></a></p>

<p>A screenshot from <em>Hayate the Combat Butler: Cuties</em> (Left) and A similar expression in comic (Right) (<em>Hayate the Combat Butler</em> Vol.324, 8)</p>
<p>​    However, the animation cannot use tricks such as changing the size of the image. Besides, as animation is played during a period, the image on the left can only be one scene and last for only a few seconds, making it less impressive to viewers. Also, when we consider the whole work, as the production of animation can be much higher than a comic, the animation can only include a reduced amount of the comic. It seems these factors can make animation perform not so well in presenting interesting things in daily life, which is emphasized by the comic.</p>
<p>​    Well, the analysis above is only using a comic point of view to see the animation. We can only say animation didn’t do so well in presenting the interesting things of daily life in a moment style. What the form of animation can do is continuously tell viewers the whole story. All the things are presented in a 20-minute episode with a very clear timeline, making it more appealing and easy to understand. Besides, as an adapted version of the comic, the animation can tell the whole story in a smoother timeline and continuous way. In the fourth season of <em>Hayate the Combat Butler</em>, we can notice the animation is telling things in a biographic way, telling some stories only of a single character. This means the animation completely changes the sequence of the comic to give viewers a better sight of what happened in the character’s daily life.</p>
<p>​    Another strength of animation is that it is colored, which looks more similar to reality and makes viewers tend to accept what happened in it Take the image below as an example, we can notice that the sunlight is projected on Nagi’s head and clothing, which in the image are shown in different colors. Light and shades are widely used to make the 2-D form possess some 3-D features and be more real. The realness does not express the theme better, but it can make it easier for viewers to accept what is expressed.</p>
<p> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgtg.com/image/mw94t"><img src="https://i.imgtg.com/2022/10/04/mw94t.png" alt="mw94t.png"></a></p>
<p>A scene where the light and shade can be clearly shown</p>
<p>​    From the analysis, we found that animation and comics can both express representational ideas well from different aspects. This relationship between the two reminds me of Plato’s allegory of Cave. According to Plato, “prisoners are shown projections of puppets onto the wall, which is considered as an imitation of the puppets” (Plato, 1132). In this way, animation and comics are two projections of the same puppet, aboutness. So if we completely take this theory, there exists a form that is more “similar” or better represents the theme. But this is not the case. In the example of <em>Hayate the Combat Butler</em>, both the two forms perform very well and serve the purpose of bringing laughter to viewers.</p>
<p>​    The problem in the previous metaphor is that it takes the “aboutness” in formalism theory as a fixed object waiting to be imitated or represented. As in a comic, the theme is expressed in the process of the comic or animation goes on, and the metaphor can be modified into that the theme is no longer a single point but a direction. We can say the “imitation idea” understands the theme as a point and the form as a path. The best form can be decided by which path goes nearest to the theme. But the real case, at least in comics and animation similar to <em>Hayate the Combat Butler</em>, its theme is not a point that needs to be reached, interesting things are hiding in the process of story-telling, every scene of the comic, and every minute of the animation. If each form is still a path, then what it wants to express is a direction. The Adapted version only goes a different route. With adapted characters and plots, animation decides how to go through the route rather than which direction to go or which way to go. Of course, the original comic can influence the way for the animation to go, which includes the plot and the characters, but they are two different things. The theme is contained, or represented in every episode or scene and leads the whole storyline just like every step of the path can show the direction and the direction is the big picture of the whole path.</p>
<p>​    A point that needs to be clarified is that this does not mean the form that goes further is better. Truly, it can be deduced from neo-formalism that the form that represents the theme better is better. But in the metaphor, it’s no meaning in saying whether a route can represent the direction better. That’s because art is not a metaphor, it is art. Different forms of art cannot be compared, as they are different routes starting from different origins. In the case of comics and animation, every single form can be adjusted to make the representation better, for example, the animation can be added with more details. But separately, they cannot be compared with each other. Art of different forms can reach its own best state, but there are no “best among best states of different forms. They are isolated.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the animation and the comic can perform very well in reaching the author’s goal and be considered art. For each form, its theme is not a destination but something that is shown in the process of appreciation. Different forms can have something in common, such as the storyline and characters, but they cannot be compared by which form represents its theme better.</p>
