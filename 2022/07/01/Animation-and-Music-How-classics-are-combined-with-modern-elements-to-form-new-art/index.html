<h2 id="Speech-Draft"><a href="#Speech-Draft" class="headerlink" title="Speech Draft"></a>Speech Draft</h2><p>The speech draft is shown as below:</p>
<h4 id="Page-1"><a href="#Page-1" class="headerlink" title="Page 1"></a>Page 1</h4><p>Today we will talk about animation and music. Today we don’t want to discuss whether animation is art. We can suppose it is if we see animation as an extension as movie, which is now widely considered movie. Today we want to talk about the relationship between two art: animation and it’s music. I don’t want to use background music, as sometimes it may ont only be background. Now you may be at a loss about what I’m going to say, so let me give you some example first.</p>
<h4 id="Page-2"><a href="#Page-2" class="headerlink" title="Page 2"></a>Page 2</h4><p>Let’s do what we did in class: Please listen to a piece of music and tell me what can you see.</p>
<p>Now what’s in your mind? You can share your answers with me in the chatbox.</p>
<p>In my mind, there is a flying cat like this —— yes, it’s Tom.</p>
<h4 id="Page-3"><a href="#Page-3" class="headerlink" title="Page 3"></a>Page 3</h4><p>If you haven’t seen Tom and Jerry or are completely at a loss what I’m talking about, don’t worry. Let’s see this piece of video.</p>
<h4 id="Page-4"><a href="#Page-4" class="headerlink" title="Page 4"></a>Page 4</h4><p>(video).</p>
<h4 id="Page-5"><a href="#Page-5" class="headerlink" title="Page 5"></a>Page 5</h4><p>So now you may have a better understanding about today’s topic. We want to discuss the relationship between the music and the animation. We’ll go from imitation to representation, then to some Hume’s and Benjamin’s idea. After that, we’ll show another example of the art of combination.</p>
<h4 id="Page-6"><a href="#Page-6" class="headerlink" title="Page 6"></a>Page 6</h4><p>So let’s first come to the question: is this imitation. I mean, in class, we know the music is imitation elephant, birds, and other animals. We can say ,the piece of piano is imitating the action of Tom. The fast-paced music represent Tom’s hard-work of getting himself into the sky. The joyful tune is what Tom feels when he discovered a way to fly.</p>
<p>However, is this the real case? When we look at what the music is, we found we went on a wrong way. This is a piece of classic piano composed by Chopin, much earlier than Tom.</p>
<p>Can Tom imitating the music? Of course not. The animation is not aimed at imitation Chopin but amuse viewers.</p>
<p>Of course you can I don’t care. I know it is interesting, that’s enough. But we now want to find a theory that can explain why it is interesting.</p>
<p>Let’s throw this idea into rubbish bin.</p>
<h4 id="Page-7"><a href="#Page-7" class="headerlink" title="Page 7"></a>Page 7</h4><p>Now we move on to representation. Still, who represents who? The word here is quite confusing here, as represent is a verb. Now, we change it to the music can be a representation of the animation. This is the case happened to the viewers, as for me, I thought of Tom at hearing the music. So who make the music able to represent Tom? Of course not Chopin as he didn’t know Tom. We can say it is the producer of the animation. He\She combines the music with the animation to make Chopin’s piano be a representation. But why do viewers take his idea? I mean, why viewers accept? If I want to say, Tom can reprsent SJTU or JI, you will not accept my idea.</p>
<p>We know Lotus is not Bourbon Dynasty but it can represent it. As they show something common. Similarly, Tom’s action shares something with this piece of piano.</p>
<h4 id="Page-8"><a href="#Page-8" class="headerlink" title="Page 8"></a>Page 8</h4><p>This idea is what Hume agrees.  He has a interesting comment: “The abstract philosophy of Cicero isn’t believed today; the power of his oratory still wins our admiration”. He means people of different era can appreciate the same art. Why? We found that in the “standard of taste”, the word “general” is used 22 times. He believe art is a concept that something general among humans. To make one’s taste better, he\she need to taste art from different era and cultures to make his taste sensitive. This implies that there are something common  about art. </p>
<p>Like in this case, the music shares the fast-pacing and fantasy feeling. Also they shares a happy feeling. Maybe the feeling of flying. Want to fly is a deep-rooted human wish. Maybe so are cats. If we take art as a concept, the animation and the music are both the representation of the concept? The idea seems familiar? Now we take back Polato’s idea from the rubbish bin and see. If art is a concept, then both the music and animation are both imitating it. We can see the concept as the cilinder in the middile, and music and animation are two projection of it.</p>
<p>So what’s the art effect combine the two different things? How can the two art affecting each other?</p>
<p>We first see the second question through the reproduction theory.</p>
<h4 id="Page-9"><a href="#Page-9" class="headerlink" title="Page 9"></a>Page 9</h4><p>First of course, the animation helped the classic music be more democratic, as I believe most of us, if have listened piece of music, mostly is because of Tom and Jerry.</p>
<p>The deeper reason is the animation represents the music in a more public way. It successfully turns a fine art into a understandable even children. It cultivates the public’s taste to understand a classic.</p>
<p>For animation the music helped it to present the feeling of flying and make the atmosphere more enjoyable.</p>
<p>In this example, the music and animation only focuses on the feeling of flying, but in other cases, choosing music can have some deeper meaning. Let’s look at another example.</p>
<p>So what’s the art effect combine the two different things? </p>
<h4 id="Page-10"><a href="#Page-10" class="headerlink" title="Page 10"></a>Page 10</h4><p>Let us look at the animation called Suka Suka, or World End.</p>
<p>It is a fantasy story. In the story, humans  and all creatures on the ground are destroyed by some beasts. The surviving races now make their homes, towns, and cities up on floating islands in the sky to escape Beasts on the ground. Only a group of elfs are weapons to defend the beasts as they have special strength.</p>
<p>A human —— who accidentally survived the disaster but lost all his family, became the administrator of the elfs. He fell in love with an elf, who finally sacrifice herself to save the floating world.</p>
<p>In the animation, the song Scarbrough’s Fair is used twice, one at the beginning and another at the end. Lets now watch a short part of the beginning. </p>
<h4 id="Page-11"><a href="#Page-11" class="headerlink" title="Page 11"></a>Page 11</h4><p>“Scarborough Fair” is composed in Scotland 13th century. It’s lyric talks about unrequited love. A young man requests impossible tasks from his lover, saying that if she can perform them, he will take her back.</p>
<h4 id="Page-12"><a href="#Page-12" class="headerlink" title="Page 12"></a>Page 12</h4><p>In the animation, the Scarborough Fair at the beginning gives the viewers a felling of fantasy and a bit sorrow. The style of the animation fits the song very well and pull viewers into the fiction world and ancient time.</p>
<p>The plot seems to give some explanation of the lyrics. Maybe the man loves the woman, and he knows he wouldn’t come, so he gives the woman such uncompletable requirements. In the animation, the man and his lover also never met again, and they know they probably cannot stay together for too long. The background of war and disaster is the same for the song and the anime. </p>
<h4 id="Page-13"><a href="#Page-13" class="headerlink" title="Page 13"></a>Page 13</h4><p>The combination gives us a chance to connect the old story. As we said, “Whatever has happened before will happen again. “ The things happened in history can also happen in fictions. And people’s emotion are the same. The animation can be a explanation, a representation of the song. The same, the song can be a representation. Note that it is can be, but not is a representation. The animation explained the song in a completely different era.</p>
<p>The art effect is we viewers are put into a feeling of time. This is a eternal topic of human beings, love and war. The music amplifies viewers’ emotion towards the tragedy. To make the whole effect better, the music’s tune is changed in different parts. In the beginning, as we heard, the music is quite Melodious, but when in the end , Scarbrough’s Fair was changed into a sorrow tune. The change of tune is not only a representation of the multi-face of the song, also the change of emotions of characters.</p>
<p>In this case, the story of the song is closely connected with the theme of the animation. Conclusively, the art effect represents as it can better move the audiences and make the love tragedy have more sense of time. We can be completely absorbed into the story.</p>

<h4 id="Page-15"><a href="#Page-15" class="headerlink" title="Page 15"></a>Page 15</h4><p>My presentation end here. I like Tom and Jerry and Suka Suka myself very much. If you have questions, don’t hesitate to ask me.</p>
