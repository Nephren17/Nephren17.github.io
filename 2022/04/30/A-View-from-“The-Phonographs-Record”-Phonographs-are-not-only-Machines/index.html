<p>In 1821, English Scientist Michael Faraday produced the first motor. From then on, electricity began to enter every field of people’s life. With the development of the knowledge of the electromagnetic field, electricity finally entered the music field in about 1900. In 1877, the phonograph was invented; in 1897, the radio was invented; in 1907, the first radio broadcast was conducted. With the advent of these new inventions, the way that people listen to music was completely changed.</p>
<p>In China, the 1900s is not only a period when phonographs appeared but also a time when western culture was introduced, a time when the country’s regime was significantly changing, a time when war and peace were frequently replaced. In that period, a debate in literature and art occurred. People hold different opinions on why should artworks and articles be created, whether it is a way for authors to make money or should it promote revolution. Leftists, who believe authors are responsible for promoting revolution, criticized some authors for only focused on the commercial value of their works. The debate on phonographs can be a clear lens to reflect this debate on literature. </p>
<p>Leftists, most of which advocate revolution, promote using phonographs as tools for revolution and criticize capitalists for only using phonographs as entertaining commodities. In their view, Zhou Shoujuan, the author of “The phonograph Record”, is a typical author of Mandarin Duck and Butterfly School, a school that mainly produces popular literature for entertainment. So people, especially the left-wing authors, consider Zhou and his school only to focus on entertainment. However, in “The Phonograph Record”, Zhou proposed a view other than his school and the leftists on phonographs. In his story, phonographs are living things and spokesmen for the human souls, instead of machines to be sold or help the revolution.</p>
<p>In the 1920s, it is natural for most people to consider phonographs as commodities. This trend can be shown by the experience of Fred Gaisberg, a star scout working for G&amp;T company. According to the second part of <em>Gaisberg’s diary</em> edited by Hugo Strötbaum, Gaisberg’s team had recorded 325 records until March 27th, 1903 (47). According to statistics in <em>Between Entertainment and Revolution: Gramophones, Records and Cultural Transfer in Republican China</em> by Andreas Steen, on average, they recorded 32 records a day, a huge amount at that time (64). Most of these records are finally sold back to China after being produced in Britain. Pathé, Beka, G&amp;T, and many other phonograph record companies are also active during that period (67-79).</p>
<p>This trend is also mentioned in Zhou’s story. An interesting fact is that the aim of Andrew Jones, the translator of the story, to translate the story is to show the influence of the Pathé company in China. As he argued in <em>Yellow Music:</em> <em>media culture and colonial modernity in the Chinese jazz age</em>, “Such was the dominance, both real and imagined, of Pathé that when the hero of a late 1920s Zhou Shoujuan short story, ‘Phonograph Record’, wants to record his last words for his lost love in Shanghai, he calls for the manager of the local Pathé branch office, even though he is living on a fanciful Isle of Regret situated in the middle of the Pacific” (164). This can also show that people at that time sees phonographs and sound as commodities, as there existed companies that are specifically profiting through selling records.</p>
<p>The reason for people holding the perspective that phonographs and records are commercial lies in the easy “repetition” created by phonographs. “Repetition”, the concept raised in <em>Noise: The Political Economy of Music</em> by Jacque Attali, means how a piece of voice or music can be produced repeatedly (87). In the past, “repetition” can only be done through the repetitive performances of artists, making music cannot be an easy “exchange and profit” (Attali 88). However, phonographs can change this situation and make “repetition” easy and cheap, thus enabling people to sell a piece of sound.</p>
<p>However, the leftists at that time raised a different opinion. Phonographs, in their eyes, are good tools to inspire people to participate in the revolution. This trend can be also clearly seen in Guo Moruo’s “Phonograph Theory”. According to Andrew Jones’s <em>Yellow Music</em>, Guo hoped that music composers in China “be phonographs”, which means they should listen to the need of the mass, compose them into music, and then use the music to inspire the mass to conduct a revolution (107). A typical “phonograph” composer listed by Jones is Nie Er, the composer of China’s national anthem (105). According to Jones, Nie Er was moved by the mass’s strong desire to get rid of the Feudal bureaucrats and foreign invaders, so he devoted himself to “recording” the mass’s voices and composing songs to inspire the mass (105-107). As Guo and Nie are both famous and influential authors and composers at that time, their theories and experience are representative of people at that time. From the description, we can notice that phonographs are still seen as a tool, whose aim is no longer money but revolution. As this point of view still, focus on the function of the phonograph without noticing the meaning of the phonograph, the leftists are likely to consider that phonographs are still seen as commodities in Zhou’s story.</p>
<p>There’re reasons for leftists to consider phonographs a good helper for revolution. They took advantage of the easy “repetition” of phonographs not to “exchange and profit” like capitalists, but to spread ideology. For them, easier “repetition” means a faster and wider spread of ideas. In the specific era when China is changing from a federal society to a modern society, the ideology most necessary to be spread was about revolution. So leftists would take phonographs as tools to serve the revolution.</p>
<p>In this context of history, Zhou raised a third voice. Sound and phonographs are no longer tools, but spokesmen for souls, things that can express emotion and act like humans.</p>
<p>In “The Phonograph Record”, Qin Jiesheng and Lin Qianyu fell in love with each other, but they are not allowed to marry each other because of their families (82). Qin was sad when he knew Lin finally married another man which was appointed by Lin’s family and he went to an island full of those who were disappointed in love (84-85). On that island, most people were having parties all day long to relieve their sorrows, but Qin choose to spend his time alone and never talk to others (85-86). Qin had watched the waves and thought about Lin all day long until he was too sick and finally died there. Before his death, he recorded his last voice and send the phonograph record to Lin (87). After hearing Qin’s voice, Lin can’t control her emotions toward Qin and kept communicating with the record. She finally passed away because of lovesickness (89-90).</p>
<p>In the story, phonographs and sounds are more than a tool for the man and the woman. Qin, the man, made a record, instead of writing a letter, to express his emotion to the woman before he died (Zhou 87). The women “shed[s] tears for each word that emerged from the machine”, and “sa[ys] many many things to the record” (Zhou 90). After the death of the man, Lin also did consider the record as the man himself, as she even tried to communicate with the record (Zhou 90). We can notice that the phonograph and record are viewed not as dead machines, but as holy and living things.</p>
<p>There are objective reasons for Lin to believe the phonograph was the man. According to <em>The Audible Past: Cultural Origins of Sound Reproduction</em> written by Jonathan Stern, phonographs provide listeners “a private acoustic space” where people can be isolated from the outside (Stern 153). However, from this perspective, “private” does not mean they can own the sound as a commodity, but they can hear the sound alone. In this private space, people can enjoy themselves without being exposed to the outside. Privatization, or being alone enables people to separate listening from other senses, thus making the experience of listening better (Stern 154). In Zhou’s story, he mentioned that “From that time on, as soon as Qianyu saw that her husband had gone out, she would immediately lock the door and listen to the phonograph record” (Zhou, 90). Qianyu’s behavior of locking the door creates a private space, making her more focused on the man’s record, thus more believing that the man is communicating with her (Zhou 89). Without being known by others, Qianyu tends to believe things that are mysterious and impossible, like a dead person can talk to her (Zhou 90).</p>
<p>Another objective reason is that phonographs also provide a “stereo image”, which means a 3-D image, to convince people that what they heard is real instead of a record (Stern 155). According to Stern, the sound heard from the left ear and right ear is “slightly different”, so listeners can “get a three-dimensional sense” (Stern 155). Although maybe the original purpose of being private is to profit commercially, this does help raise the quality of the sound. As listeners put most of their attention on hearing when they’re in a private space, they believe they’re facing something real when the sound is steric and 3-D (Stern 159). In Zhou’s story, the private space can provide the phonograph with an environment to produce steric sound, which may persuade the woman into believing the man is standing in front of her.</p>
<p>Besides the objective and technique reasons above, people’s cognitive habits may affect their behavior. The phenomenon can partly be caused by people’s tendency to treat what they are unfamiliar with as something mysterious. As a new technique, phonographs are magical to the mass that knew little about how phonographs worked. Similar ideas that see the phonograph as something holy can also be found in western literature. In “Death and the Shell”, a French story written by Maurice Renard, the narrator, and his friend, Nerval, feel sad after hearing the record of one of their dead friend’s voices (51). Then, they heard the sound of a shell and came up with an idea that what they heard is what the shell heard just before its death. Both two sounds imply the deep connection between sound and life (54). Sound is given a holy understanding relating to the dead and living people. What deserves noticing is that Renard published this story in 1907, thirteen years before Zhou published his story. The phonograph is also a technique first invented in the west and then introduced into China. We can deduce that the idea is partly caused by people’s unfamiliarity with phonographs.</p>
<p>However, only the technical and objective reasons above are not enough to persuade someone to see a machine as a human. In the story, Zhou particularly mentioned that “A letter might be able to convey my meaning, but not my voice. She always loved listening to the phonograph, so I think I would like to make a record of my voice and send it to her.” (Zhou 88). So there must exist a deeper cultural reason for people to prioritize sound. We can notice that in western culture, people tend to believe voice is holy and living. This can be explained by the theory in <em>The Soundscape</em> by R. Murray Schafer, that we always give priority to the ear (Schafer 101). He mentioned that before Renaissance, God is only described by music and had never been portrayed. This fact can show that people in the west had long seen hearing as a more prioritized sense (Schafer 101). From this point, sound and voice are the symbols of humanity and god, not in Attali’s words, “[a] material object of exchange and profit” (Attali 88). In the 20th century, the spread of Christianity and western culture also influenced the Chinese. This trend can also be reflected in the story. Zhou mentioned that “Qianyu began to suspect that he had taken his own life, but then she recalled that he had been a Christian” (Zhou 87). The deep-rooted western influence can lead to the trend of the sanctification of phonographs.</p>
<p>When considering the purpose of Zhou to create the story, many people, most leftists believe this is only for entertainment. There’re reasons for them to think so, as Zhou’s school do mainly produced popular literature and is widely welcomed among the mass. Most authors in the school believe literature is only entertainment and their aim of writing books is to earn money. However, the leftists didn’t accept this opinion. From Guo’s phonograph theory and Nie Er’s personal experience described in <em>Yellow Music</em>, we can know that the leftists believe that not only phonographs, but composers should also serve the revolution (Jones 105). They promoted that articles should be written to serve the era. In their opinions, as the revolution was the most important thing in that era, all articles should focus on the theme. So it was natural for the left-wing authors to criticize authors in Zhou’s school as “only focused on entertainment” and believe this story is also one of the entertaining works.</p>
<p>Although Zhou’s other works may serve the purpose of amusement, the idea contained in “The Phonograph Record” is more than entertainment. In the 1920s, the time when “The Phonograph Record” was published, Zhou was the main editor of <em>Free Talk</em>, one of the most influential literary supplements at that time in China. His work was of literary significance.</p>
<p>The idea that it expressed about the meaning of phonograph and voice is long-living. This idea can be found throughout literature in different periods. In <em>300 Tang Poems</em> translated by Xu Yuanchong, thousands of years before, He Zhizhang, a Chinese poet wrote that “I left home young and not till old do I come back. Unchanged my accent, my hair no longer black.” (Xu 57). For He, his voice can show the deep connection between him and his family in his hometown. His accent is his self-identity and a part of himself. For Qin and Lin in Zhou’s Story, the voice in the record can be the way they can communicate with each other even if they’re physically separated by life and death. Even today many works are promoting the idea that voices can represent a person. In the animated movie <em>Violet Evergarden: The Movie</em>, a dying sick boy named Yuris chose to say goodbye to his best friend by telephone because he wanted to be heard at the last moment of his life. Voice is still seen as a way to represent a person. What Zhou express is beyond the era. Sound and voice are always human’s spokesmen that can express our feeling and be a part of us. Although the form of voice can be changed with time, from accent to record and telephone, its meaning stays unchanged for humans.</p>
<p>When the whole society was only promoting the idea of revolution, Zhou’s story served as a reminder that phonographs, or voice, are much more than a tool. In the era when the revolution was promoted in every field, especially literature, there need someone to remind people phonographs and literature not only serve for revolution. Like phonographs are not only machines, literature has its distinctive meaning. Undoubtedly, at that time, the revolution should be the prevalent voice, but people also shouldn’t forget that phonographs and voices are spokesmen for people’s souls. What Zhou wanted to promote is that emotions can be expressed through the phonograph and voice, which have some unique meaning to human beings.</p>
